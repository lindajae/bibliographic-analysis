Hornsveld, W. M. M. Kessels, Mariadriana Creatore","Deposition, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, Ellipsometry","High purity, uniform, and conformal aluminum phosphate (AlPₓOy) thin films were deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) between 25 and 300 °C using supercycles consisting of (i) PO(OMe)₃ dosing combined with O₂ plasma exposure and (ii) AlMe₃ dosing followed by O₂ plasma exposure. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and mass spectrometry were applied to demonstrate the ALD self-limiting behavior and to gain insight into the surface reactions during the precursor and coreactant exposures, respectively. Compared to earlier reported AlPₓOy ALD studies using H₂O and O₃ as coreactants or without using coreactans, the use of an oxygen plasma generally leads to higher growth per cycle values and promotes phosphorus incorporation in the film. Specifically, when using a 1:1 POₓ:Al₂O₃ cycle ratio and a substrate temperature of 150 °C, the growth per supercycle is found to be 1.8 A. The [P]:[Al] atomic ratio for this process is approximately 0.5 (∼AlP₀.₅O₂.₉) and can be tailored by changing the ratio between the two cycles or the substrate temperature. In literature reports where the same aluminum precursor was used, the [P]:[Al] atomic ratio was limited to 0.2 or a very high number of phosphorus cycles was needed in order to increase the phosphorus content. Instead, we demonstrate deposition of films with a composition close to AlPO₄ by using a 2:1 POₓ:Al₂O₃ cycle ratio. The limited incorporation of P in the film is suspected to derive from the steric hindrance of the relatively bulky phosphorus precursor. Mass spectrometry suggests that the PO(OMe)₃ precursor chemisorbs on the surface without the release of reaction products into the gas phase, whereas Al(Me)₃ already undergoes methyl ligand abstraction upon chemisorption.",the journal of physical chemistry,"['0022-3654', '1541-5740']",journal,1,[],Hornsveld,,False,

Jones, Natasha Chugh, Jincheng Du, Frank L. Pasquale, Adrien R. Lavoie, Jeffry A. Kelber","Reactivity, Deposition, Hydrogen atom abstraction","Oxygen plasma is crucial to many atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes, and O(³P) radicals play a significant role in terms of reactivity and surface modification. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), residual gas analysis mass spectrometry (RGA-MS), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were used to study the free-radical-assisted ALD of boron oxide (B₂O₃) films on Si(100) using trimethyl borate [B(OCH₃)₃] and mixed O(³P)/O₂ effluents at room temperature at varying levels of O(³P)/O₂ flux to the surface. Under these conditions, no reaction with pure O₂ was observed. The XPS results show that at low O(³P)/O₂ flux, a complete removal of alkyl ligands is observed and C-free B₂O₃ is achieved, with CO₂ and H₂O as the main reaction products. At higher O(³P)/O₂ fluxes, the formation of a stable oxidized C surface layer is observed with some C incorporation into the growing B₂O₃ film. In both flux regimes, the B₂O₃ film thickness increased linearly with the number of cycles, consistent with an ALD process. AIMD simulations of O(³P) collisions with B(OCH₃)₃ indicate a multistep ligand removal mechanism initiated by hydrogen abstraction at a threshold O(³P) energy of ∼0.1 eV, consistent with RGA-MS results. In contrast, C oxidation and incorporation in the high-flux regime result from O₂ termination of the O(³P)-induced C radical sites. This work demonstrates that the purity of B₂O₃ films, efficiency of ligand removal, and surface reaction products can be flux-dependent.",the journal of physical chemistry,"['0022-3654', '1541-5740']",journal,1,[],Pilli,,False,

It is based on self-limiting chemical reactions that ensure the layer-by-layer growth of the film. This unique growth mode is fundamental to the fine control of both film thickness and structure. The film grows conformally on the substrate, following the morphology of the surface. ALD can grow films at low temperature, making possible the use of temperature-sensitive substrates. A slightly modified technique called molecular layer deposition (MLD) utilises organic precur-sors to deposit fully organic films. Hybrid inorganic-organic materials can be deposited with a combination of ALD and MLD. The aim of this research was to utilise the unique characteris-tics of ALD/MLD in two different applications, thermoelectrics and barrier coatings. 
Thermoelectric devices were fabricated on flexible plastic, glass, and textile. Testing of the barrier properties of ALD-grown films were carried out on 3D printed plastic substrates. The conformality of the deposition is fundamental in both applications. The films needed to coat the single fibres within the textile substrate as well as the porous surface of the 3D printed plastic. The low deposition temperature made it possible to use cotton as well as various plas-tics as substrates. The fine control over the film thickness and structure, enabled the deposi-tion of inorganic-organic superlattice hybrid materials. Zinc oxide (ZnO) and hydroquinone (HQ) were chosen for the fabrication of the thermoelectric devices while aluminium oxide (AlOx) was the chosen barrier material. Hydroquinone was utilised as monomolecular layers within the ZnO matrix to lower thermal conductivity and enhance the thermoelectric perfor-mance. 
The ALD-deposited AlOx coating was shown to successfully lower the vacuum degassing of the 3D printed plastics compared to commercial sealants. These superior performances open the way to inexpensive and personalised, 3D printed, laboratory tools coated with ALD which pro-vide degassing protection to the vacuum environment. 
Thermoelectric devices were fabricated on several substrates (silicon, flexible plastic, flexible glass, and textile) using the n-type ZnO as thermoelectric. On textile, the device was made with both n-type (ZnO or ZnO-HQ) and p-type (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) - PEDOT) components to improve performance. The ZnO-HQ superlattice outperformed the bare ZnO films, proving that the hybrid approach is worth pursuing to reduce thermal conductivity. The best device fabricated on textile, produced an open-circuit voltage around 150 mV at a ΔT of 20 °C with a power output in the order of pW. These numbers, although low, are paving the way for future application of the ALD/MLD in the fabrication of thermoelectric devices inte-grated into smart clothing.",,,,0,[],Marín,,False,

The atomic layer deposition (ALD) process optimization allowed for the control of the structural, chemical, and electrochemical properties of Li1+xMn2-xO4, LixAlySizO, as well as their interfacial properties that ultimately dictate electrochemical performance. The synthesis of Li1+xMn2-xO4 combined a plasma enhanced ALD process for MnO2 and a thermal process for ALD LiOH. The PEALD MnO2 showed self-limiting growth, stable composition (within 5% relative composition), and well-controlled growth rate over a temperature range of 205-265�C. As synthesized and amorphous ALD Li1+xMn2-xO4 films were crystallized into the electrochemically active spinel phase. Tuning of the ALD cycle ratio led to controlled Li content in Li1+xMn2-xO4 (x = 0-0.33), exhibiting electrochemical activity in both the 3.0V and 4.0V region depending on the stoichiometry. The Li1+xMn2-xO4 thin films exhibited great rate capability and capacity retention—maintaining 66% of the areal capacity upon increasing the rate by a factor of a 100 as well as 97% capacity retention over 100 cycles at 35.9 �A cm-2 (~5C). The measured volumetric capacity was 52 �Ah cm-2 �m-1 at ~C/2 and 45 �Ah cm-2 �m-1 after 100 cycles at ~5C, offering the potential for superior areal energy densities. Amorphous LixAlySizO thin films were synthesized and integrated on SiGe alloying anodes. Using in-situ transmission electron microscopy, the electrolyte layer was remained intact during the lithiation induced volume expansion of the nanowire for two different electrolyte thicknesses (8 and 20 nm). A novel hybrid solid-state electrolyte consisting of sequential deposition of ALD LixAlySizO and iCVD PV4D4 was synthesized to improve upon the mechanical properties of LixAlySizO for direct integration with high capacity anodes. Integration on Co3O4 thin films resulted in increased capacity-retention with continuous cycling with a discharge capacity 8.4% higher as compared to the uncoated Co3O4 anode after 100 cycles at ~2C.The stoichiometry of ALD LixAlySizO was controlled to allow for crystallization in the β-eucryptite phase for improved ionic conductivities. The crystallized LiAlSiO4 exhibited a well-defined epitaxial relationship of β-LiAlSiO4 (12 10) || Si (100) and β-LiAlSiO4 (101 0) || Si(001). The ionic conductivity of the crystallized thin film was around two orders higher than the amorphous as-deposited films (10-7 vs. 10-9 S/cm) at room temperature. Due to the unique 1-D channel along the c-axis of β-LiAlSiO4, the epitaxial thin film has the potential to facilitate ionic transport if oriented with the c-axis normal to the electrode surface making it a promising electrolyte material for 3D lithium-ion Microbatteries, where a properly oriented film offers the opportunity to achieve higher ionic conductivities.",,,,0,[],Sheil,,False,

Rate laws based on species of AlCH₃ groups that also predict a biexponential decay are found to depend on unrealistic activation energies for their constituent reactions when applied to the data. However, a model in which the effective activation energy changes linearly with AlCH₃ coverage does adequately fit the data. This model produces the apparent biexponential decay at low temperatures, and it confirms prior suggestions of a coverage dependence in the rate constant. The decrease in the effective activation energy with increasing coverage can be interpreted in terms of a cooperative effect between adjacent AlCH₃ groups. These findings may provide a framework for further studies, and both the kinetic model and parametric fits to the data may be useful in the construction of models of this important ALD process.",the journal of physical chemistry,"['0022-3654', '1541-5740']",journal,0,[],Sperling,,False,

The well-observed behavior of an optimum catalytic activity as a function of the Pt loading is usually explained by the shift from charge separation to charge recombination behavior of Pt clusters. However, experiments supporting this explanation are still lacking to give a concise understanding of the effect of Pt on the photocatalytic activity. Here, we present an experimental study that tries to discriminate the different effects influencing the photocatalytic activity. Using atomic layer deposition in a fluidized bed reactor, we prepared TiO₂ (P25) samples with Pt loadings ranging from 0.04 wt % to around 3 wt %. In order to reveal the mechanism behind the photocatalytic behavior of Pt on P25, we investigated the different aspects (i.e., surface area, reactant adsorption, light absorption, charge transfer, and reaction pathway) of heterogeneous photocatalysis individually. In contrast to the often proposed prolonged lifetime of charge carriers in Pt-loaded TiO₂, we found that after collecting the excited electrons, Pt acts more as a recombination center independent of the amount of Pt deposited. Only when dissolved O₂ is present in the solution, charge recombination is suppressed by the subsequential consumption of electrons at the surface of the Pt clusters with the dissolved O₂ benefited by the improved O₂ adsorption on the Pt surface.",the journal of physical chemistry,"['0022-3654', '1541-5740']",journal,1,[],Benz,,False,

The films were prepared from alloy (Zn: Ga) and ceramic (ZnO: Ga) targets with gallium composition of 3 at% and 4 at%, respectively. Crystal structure and phase analysis were measured using X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The XRD structural analysis results indicated that all multilayered films were polycrystalline with (002) orientation slightly shifted of diffracting angles due to gallium dopant concentrations as increase in the deposition temperatures. The films were hexagonal wurtzite structure, having preferred growth orientation in c-axis perpendicular to the substrate surface. The cross section micrographs imaging and elemental composition of multi-layered ZnO: Ga films were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. The films' surface morphology and grain size approximations were studied by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) operated in the tapping mode. Grain size approximations observed in atomic force microscopy scans were confirmed by Debye Scherrer's formula. Optical transmittance and electrical properties of multi-layered films were studied using the UV-VIS spectrophotometer and Ecopia HMS-3000 Hall Effect measurement equipment. Film deposited at substrate temperature of 270 °C showed the best desired results of structural, optical and electrical properties. The film has optical transmittance of over 91% and the lowest resistivity of 1.8  10–4 Ω-cm corresponding to the highest carrier concentration of 4.8  1021 cm-3 and Hall mobility of 7.5 cm2 /Vs were obtained.

Yellaiah",Meteor shower,"The meteoroid disintegration mechanism is a subject of interest as they are the sources for metallic layers in MLT region, ionsopheric sporadic E, Noctilucent clouds and other aeronomy. It is known that meteoroid mass is deposited in the upper atmosphere either through fragmentation or through differential and simple ablation mechanisms. Each mechanism deposits the flux in different form (dust/ smoke-fragmentation, atomic form-ablation). Both the Leonid Meteor Shower (LMS) (parent body-Comet 55P/ Tempel - tuttle) and Geminid Meteor Shower (GMS)(parent body Asteroid- Phaethon 3200) are observed using MST Radar at NARL, Gadanki (13.5N, 79.2E). The atmospheric sodium density during the Geminid Meteor shower (GMS) is estimated using co - located sodium LIDAR. The ablation and fragmentation mechanisms of the meteoroid influx during these showers are studied using RTI plots from In phase and Quadrature channels of MST Radar, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by estimating moments and line of sight velocities. Our observations using MST Radar disclosed an important outcome that the asteroid originated meteoroids (Geminids) are undergoing less fragmentation when compared to comet originated meteoroids (Leonids). The fragmentation percentage estimated during the GMS is 14 % which is significantly lower than 20%, estimated for LMS. During GMS using Na LIDAR, it is also observed that the concentration of metallic sodium in ionosphere E - Region increased on peak activity day compared to pre peak day. The line of sight velocities plotted for down the beam echoes during the showers dominantly followed a smooth evolution in altitude and time, before and after the occurrences of SNR changes, indicating that the meteoroids did not undergo any abrupt physical modification such as fragmentation. Further enhancement of atomic Na concentrations in E - region ionosphere during the shower indicates the flux deposition due to ablation. After comparison it is found that the dominant meteoroid disintegration mechanism for Geminids is likely the ablation unlike the LMS. We speculate here with substantial evidence that the contribution of fragmenting meteoroids in differently originated meteoroid showers is different and may be attributed to the chemical composition of their parent bodies of the meteoroids from which they are originated. This outcome has importance of its own as their parent bodies are different, the former shower being asteroid originated and the later comet originated. These results will also contribute in improving current meteoroid single body/dust ball ablation models.",indian journal of radio & space physics (ijrsp),,journal,2,[],Narwa,,False,

However, the trend in miniaturization of AMO systems places the magnetic field of particle traps, optical isolators, and vacuum pumps close to other system components. Stray fields and field fluctuations cause changes in atomic transition frequencies, raising the noise floor and reducing the valuable stability in these precision devices. Therefore, it is critical to shield these magnetic fields away from sensitive subsystems by shunting them through low reluctance paths. This is accomplished with high permeability magnetic materials which either surround the precision components or the source of the magnetic field itself. Current magnetic shields are conventionally machined single or multi-layer structures made of various iron alloys. At smaller size scales, these manufacturing methods are ineffective at accommodating the various device and interconnect shapes, making multi-system integration challenging.This work demonstrates batch fabricated high permeability magnetic shielding using permalloy electroplating techniques to simultaneously push the limits of minimum size, maximum shielding factor, and minimum cost. In particular, it presents the first experimental demonstration of electrodeposited high permeability, compact magnetic shielding at millimeter and sub-millimeter scales of fields exceeding 15 mT. Single layer shields of 300 μm permalloy with inner dimensions varying from 3 mm to 6.5 mm were fabricated on 3D printed polymer molds using a novel double-anode plating process to enable conformal deposition with uniform material properties. Multilayer shields of 10 μm permalloy and copper layers with inner dimensions of 1.5 mm to 6 mm were microfabricated using a bulk micromachining technique. The electroplated shields were designed with appropriate thickness to avoid saturation at the specified fields and with shapes to allow sophisticated interconnect extraction – a task that is challenging for conventional machining yet simple for microfabrication and electroplating. The size and shielding factor of these structures can enable compact integration of magnetic devices for AMO microsystems and other magnetic microelectronics, such as magnetic random-access memory and haptic actuators.",,,,1,[],Wu,,False,

1999,2024,https://openalex.org/W3160649221,,pathways of biomineralization and microstructure evolution in brachiopod shells,article,2021-03-03,2021,,,,,"Simonet Roda, María del Mar",,"Biominerals of shells, bones and teeth are composits of minerals and organic tissue components precipitated by organisms. Accordingly, it is very important to understand (1) the relation between the soft and hard tissues in composite materials of living organisms, (2) the resulting micro- and nanostructure of the constituting biominerals (3) and the function of the minerals of the biomineralization epithelial cells in producing these materials. Brachiopod shells were selected to be the principal subject of this work as they are major geochemical archives for paleo-environmental reconstruction of sea water conditions.
The shell of modern brachiopods is secreted by the outer mantle epithelium (OME) of the animal. Despite several decades of research, it is still unknown how the mineral is transported from OME cells to the site of mineralization. For brachiopod shells the biomineralization process was not yet described and often biomineralization of mollusc shells was used as a reference. In order to understand mineral transport and shell secretion, we investigated the ultrastructure of OME cells and their spatial relation to the growing shell for the terebratulide brachiopod Magellania venosa (Chapters 2.1 and 2.2). The animals were chemically fixed and high pressure frozen. We worked with high resolution panorama images formed of up to 350 TEM images. This ensured a general overview as well as a detailed description of the ultrastructure of the OME. We found and described the specific differences between (1) the OME ultrastructure at the commissure and that at central shell regions as well as (2) differences between areas in the central region where active secretion takes place and those areas where secretion is finished. The OME at the commissure consists of several cell layers, while at central shell regions it is single-layered. It is significantly thinner at the central shell region in comparison to the commissure. Especially at sites of actively forming calcite fibres, OME cells are only a few tens of nanometre thin.
Where the mineral deposition takes place, the apical membrane of OME cells is in direct contact with the calcite of the forming fibre. At these sites the extracellular organic membrane at the proximal convex surface of the fibre is absent. When mineral secretion is finished the cells form an extracellular organic membrane which lines the proximal surface of fibres. The extracellular organic membrane is attached to the apical cell membrane via apical hemidesmosomes. Tonofilaments cross the cell, connect apical to basal hemidesmosomes, stabilize the contact between epithelium and fibres and keep the mantle attached to the shell. Furthermore, communication and cooperation of neighbouring OME cells could be proved in this work as individual fibres are secreted by several cooperating cells at the same time (Chapters 2.1 and 2.2).
The extracellular space, the space between the epithelium and the growing fibres, is either absent or very narrow. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that there are no significant differences in the volume fraction of vesicles between secreting and non-secreting regions of the OME. The latter and the extreme reduction in cell thickness at sites of mineral secretion suggest that for Magellania venosa shells mineral transport to the sites of mineralization does not occur by transport with organelles such as vesicles but via ion transport mechanisms through the cell membrane.
For the central shell region the previously discussed data was complemented with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements. In the central region of the shell the fibrous layer is secreted. The fibrous layer of modern terebratulide brachiopod shells has an overall plywood-like organization with the basic mineral units, the calcite fibres, being assembled with a microstructure resembling an ‘anvil-type’ arrangement (Chapter 2.2). The observations on the TEM images and on etched sample surfaces under AFM lead us to develop a model for calcite fibre secretion and fibre shape formation for Magellania venosa is described as a dynamic process coordinated by outer mantle epithelium cells (OME). The secretion process consists of the following steps: (i) local detachment of epithelial cell membrane from the organic membrane of previously formed fibres, (ii) onset of secretion of calcite at these sites, (iii) organic membrane formation along the proximal, convex side of the forming fibre during achievement of the full width of the fibre, (iv) start of membrane secretion at the corners of fibres progressing towards the centre of the fibre, (v) attachment of the cells via apical hemidesmosomes to newly formed organic membrane, and (vi) suspension of calcite secretion at sites where the proximal, organic membrane of the calcite fibre is fully developed and the apical cell membrane is attached to the latter with apical hemidesmosomes.
Thecideide brachiopods are an anomalous group of invertebrates. Their position within the phylogeny of the Brachiopoda and the identification of their origin is still not fully resolved. Studies of morphological features such as shell structure and body size aimed to shed more light on thecideide evolution. However, none of these did provide a definitive answer, possibly because of their complex and diverse evolutionary track. In this thesis (Chapter 2.3) we attempt to trace thecideide shell evolution from a microstructure and texture point of view. We describe for this group of brachiopods the appearance and disappearance of a variety of calcite biocrystals that form the shells and trace these from Late Triassic to Recent times. The results and conclusions are based on EBSD measurements that form the basis of a phylogenetic tree. With this thesis we present a new phylogenetic hypothesis for the evolution of Thecideida. This is the first study that links microstructure and texture results gained from EBSD measurements with phylogenetic analysis and implications derived from phylogenetic evolution.
BSD measurements demonstrated the presence of a large variety of mineral units within thecideide shells throughout the geological record. With geologic time there is a progressive loss of the fibrous layer in favour of highly disordered acicular and granular microstructures. This loss can be seen as a paedomorphic pattern in the complex mosaic of evolutionary changes characterizing thecideide brachiopods. The Upper Jurassic species has transitional forms. The shells are composed of stacks of acicles on the external part of the shell. The fibrous layer is kept only in some regions next to the soft tissue of the animal. The regularity of biocrystal shape, mineral unit size, and the strength of calcite co-orientation decreases from the Late Triassic to Recent species. Even though, since the Upper Jurassic the thecideide shell microstructure shows the same type of mineral unit morphologies made of (i) nanometric to small granules, (ii) acicles, (iii) fibres, (iv) polygonal crystals, (v) large roundish crystals. I deduce from my studies that the change in microstructure and texture of thecideide brachiopods may be related to the ecological strategy to exploit distinct niches and life styles, in particular attachment to hard substrates. The clear and well defined microstructure of this brachiopod group is well distinguishable and can help to unravel the phylogenetic relationships between different taxa.
Brachiopods are one of the very few marine organism groups which have a complete fossil record. First species appeared in early Cambrian. The end-Permian extinction erased the majority of Paleozoic brachiopod taxa and reset taxonomic, 
morphological, functional and ecological brachiopod diversity. A few groups survived end-Permian extinction, diversified and occupied new ecological niches. Representatives of these form today the extant orders of the Lingulida, Craniida, Rhynchonellida, and Terebratulida. The Thecideida appeared after the end-Permian crisis, in the Triassic.
The geological record shows that brachiopods were and are able to adopt to many marine environments. Accordingly, a large diversity in body plans as well as morphological, structural and chemical features of their shell became developed. With this thesis I highlight structural features of the shells of selected terebratulide, rhynchonellide, thecideide and craniide taxa. Chapter 2.4 describes the difference in shell structure for brachiopods with different life-styles, highlights the distinctness between the structure of the primary shell layer of Terebratulida, Rhynchonellida and the shell structure of Thecideida. I detail the nanometer scale calcite organization of Rhynchonellide and Terebratulide fibers, describe some advantages of a hierarchical composite hard tissue, address possible determinants for primary, fibrous and columnar shell calcite of Terebratullida and discuss a possible usage of thecideide shell for paleoenvironment reconstruction.",,,,1,[],Roda,,False,

Haverkate, F. Grob, F. Roozeboom",Degradation,"Li-ion batteries have emerged as the key energy storage technology, not only in portable electronics & gadgets but also in electric vehicles (EV) and grid-storage. A combination of high energy density anodes such as silicon or lithium, and Ni- or Li-rich cathode1,2 is necessary to achieve the targeted energy density of >350 Wh/Kg. The challenge is that such extreme redox-chemistries bring safety issues and degradation3, especially at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces4. In order to improve safety, solid polymer electrolytes5 and ceramic electrolytes6 are proposed to replace liquid electrolyte composed of organic solvents, which are highly flammable and toxic. However, most of the solid electrolytes and also the conventional liquid electrolyte (to a lesser extent), has either oxidative or reductive instability against the new generation electrodes leading to capacity degradation during cycling. In brief, most of the safety and capacity degradation issues arise from the incompatibility of electrodes and electrolytes, i.e. highly unstable interfaces. Thus, an optimized interface is the key to the success of new generation Li-ion battery in terms of stability and safety. The preffered way to achieve this is by creating artificial electrode-electrolyte interfaces that are stable against the electrochemical environment and has the ability to protect the electrode as well as electrolyte surfaces from degradation by acting as a lithium conducting barrier. These interfaces can be formed either in-situ using electrolyte additives or ex-situ via chemical or physical methods. However, in the state-of-the-art cells, the above methods have not yet been shown to guaranty the required uniform atomic layer interfacial coating at an industrial scale. The relative newcomer in this field is atomic layer deposition (ALD), has the potential to play a big role in interfacial-engineering owing to its ability to achieve conformal interfacial coatings at an atomic scale7. However, conventional vacuum-based ALD is not compatible with the high throughput roll-to-roll battery electrode production. Here, spatial ALD (sALD)8 technology, an advanced version of ALD at ambient pressure, is a prime choice due to its reel-to-reel scalability and higher throughput. TNO-Holst center has established roll-to-roll sALD in the past several years for various applications. Wide range of materials including metal, metal oxides, nitrides, sulfides, organic, polymer, and polymers are possible using sALD depending upon the chemistry and reactivity at the electrode surfaces. We will showcase various sALD films Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, etc., which are specifically tailored to address various issues such as lithium dendrite formation, interface stabilization, cathode degradation protection, etc. Thanks to the selective deposition reaction of sALD, the passivation coatings at interfaces can reach all the way down within a thick commercial electrode (50-60μm).

Inorganic micro-light-emitting diodes (μLEDs) have been considered as one of the promising candidates for next-generation display applications, and demonstrations of μLED displays have shown outstanding performances as compared to liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic-light-emitting-diode (OLED) displays. However, it has been shown that the maximum efficiency drops as the device dimensions shrink. This dissertation describes post-etch fabrication techniques that suppress or mitigate the size effect in InGaN and AlGaInP μLEDs.In this dissertation, the concepts of current display technologies, namely LCDs and OLED displays, and μLEDs will be first introduced. Moreover, the mechanism of the reduction in efficiency will also be addressed. Followed by the first chapter, a series of fabrication methods and their improvements to the device performances will be discussed in the chapters 2-4. In chapter 2, the optoelectrical improvements in the InGaN μLEDs with dielectric sidewall passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) will be illustrated. This is the first demonstration that the InGaN μLED efficiency can be partially recovered using post-etch technique. Due to the greater surface recombination velocity and minority carrier diffusion length, the effects of ALD sidewall passivation on AlGaInP μLEDs are investigated in chapter 3. This chapter also reveals the excellent optical properties of AlGaInP red emitters, and the potential elimination of the size effect in AlGaInP devices is also shown. In chapter 4, a detailed report on the performances of InGaN devices with the combination of chemical treatment and ALD sidewall passivation is presented, where this is the first demonstration of size-independent efficiency from 100×100 to 10×10 μm2 devices. Since the size effect is mitigated in InGaN and AlGaInP devices, chapter 5 shows a possible mass transfer method that employs fluidic assembly with external forces.

Different nanostructured organic and inorganic semiconductors as well as metallic co-catalysts were synthesized and combined to thin film devices, which can be envisioned to work like artificial leaves. These devices were extensively studied by various physical methods like X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Finally, their abilities regarding the harvesting of sunlight and their catalytic properties for hydrogen evolution were investigated by photoelectrochemical methods.
The first chapter describes the influence of tin doping on the performance of hematite photoanodes using model photoabsorber layers with different tin doping concentrations and concentration gradients prepared via atomic layer deposition. This study aims for the basic understanding of effects of dopants on fundamental rate-determining kinetic and recombination steps of metal oxide photoelectrodes.
The second chapter elucidates the phenomenon of photocorrosion with the example of lithium doped copper oxide photocathodes. While this material appears to be an efficient material at first glance, it corrodes by copper reduction from its own photogenerated electrons in contact with water. This observation was studied in depth to reveal the underlying mechanism of photocorrosion. Additionally, a suitable protection approach for this material is discussed and the hydrogen evolution of those final devices is quantified.
The third chapter presents the first study of covalent organic frameworks serving as photoelectrodes. By self-organization, this organic material grows conjugated two-dimensional sheets that stack in the third dimension, forming crystalline and porous polymers. The synthesized material called BDT-ETTA was grown as flat films with its one-dimensional pores oriented perpendicular to the surface of the underlying conductive substrate. Those devices were shown to exhibit a suitable band gap alignment for hydrogen evolution and were applied to reduce water by the use of sunlight. Finally, the combination with a platinum cocatalyst revealed the catalytic activity of the photoactive material itself as bottleneck for the targeted application, whereas the diversity of possible optical and electronic properties can be tuned by the selection of appropriate building blocks, offering an auspicious material system for the evolution of hydrogen from sunlight.
The fourth chapter explores electrophoretic deposition as a well-working technique for the film deposition of covalent organic frameworks, also in combination with metallic platinum nanoparticles. With the example of the previously introduced BDT-ETTA, the influence of morphology and added cocatalyst on the photoelectrochemical performance is discussed. Devices exhibiting textural porosity, in addition to the intrinsic porosity of the covalent organic framework itself, showed an increased photoactivity compared to flat electrodes. Their combination with a nanosized platinum cocatalyst leads to strongly enhanced photocurrents, alleviating the catalytic bottleneck of the discussed material.

In addition, innovative designs of various configuration structures of ZnO nanowires (NWs)/substrate have been developed for enhancing performance and multifunctional applications as piezoelectric nano-generators and sensors. In our project, the vertically aligned ZnO NW arrays exhibiting a 1031 nm length and 80-100 nm diameter, are grown on a 40nm-thick ZnO seed layer deposited on top of a 500Âµm-thick silicon substrate, and are embedded in a 1464 nm dielectric layer of polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA). Up to now, a lot of publications has been reported on exploiting piezoelectric behavior of ZnO nanowire for various applications but very few of them provided a reliable method of characterization for these materials. Thus, the idea of this study focuses on characterizing the electromechanical response of vertically aligned ZnO NW arrays/polymer composite structure via an experimental test bench. Under dynamic mechanical excitation at 1 Hz , two electric configurations were performed including an application of a dynamic electric excitation from a sinusoidal voltage of 1 kHz and a short-circuit condition. The static electrical measurment confirmed the capacitive property of composite is dominant with respect to the resistive one and electromechanical characterization demonstrated an existence of piezoelectric property of the ZnO structure (d33 ~ 1.25 pC/N). The results will lead to a better understanding of the multi-physic coupling of ZnO materials in order to validate its feasibility for flexible sensors adapted to biological media. In the future, different designs of tunable ZnO NW length and radius, together with optimization of base structure and polymer matrix will be explored in order to drastically boost the electromechanical coupling of the proposed material.
Nanowires (NW) are defined here as metallic or semiconducting particles having a high aspect ratio, with cross-sectional diameters Â« 1 I¼m, and lengths as long as tens of microns. Well-aligned one-dimensional nanowire arrays have been widely investigated as photoelectrodes for solar energy conversion because they provide direct electrical pathways ensuring the rapid collection of carriers generated throughout the device , as well as affording large junction areas and low reflectance owing to light scattering and trapping.
Solar energy conversion is a highly attractive process for clean and renewable power for the future. Excitonic solar cells (SCs), including organic and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), appear to have significant potential as a low cost alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic (PV) devices. The synthesis and application of nanostructures in solar cells have attracted much attention. Metal oxide nanowire (NW) arrays with large surface area and short diffusion length for minority carriers represent a new class of photoelectrode materials that hold great promise for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation applications. Up to now, various metal oxide nanostructures such as TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, Al2O3, and CeO2 have been successfully employed as photoelectrodes in SCs. Among the above-mentioned metal oxide nanostructures, the study of TiO2 and ZnO is of particular interest due to the fact that they are the best candidates as photoelectrode used in SCs. However, the advantage offered by the increased surface area of the nanoparticle film is compromised by the effectiveness of charge collection by the electrode. For DSSCs, the traditional nanoparticle film was replaced by a dense array of oriented, crystalline nanostructures to obtain faster electron transport for improving solar cell efficiency. A typical high-efficiency DSSC (GrA¤tzel, 2009) consists of a TiO2 nanocrystal thin film that has a large surface area covered by a monolayer of dye molecules to harvest sunlight. Comparedwith TiO2, ZnO shows higher electron mobility with similar bandgap and conduction band energies. ZnO is a direct wide bandgap semiconductor (Eg = 3.4 eV) with large exciton binding energy (~60 meV), suggesting that it is a promising candidate for stable room temperature luminescent and lasing devices. Therefore, ZnO nanowires is an alternative candidate for high efficient SCs.
So far, various ZnO nanostructures have been extensively investigated for SCs. In the early reports on ZnO-based DSSCs, ZnO nanoparticles were often used as the photoanode prepared by a conventional doctor blade technique (Keis et al., 2002; Keis et al., 2002). LA©vy-ClA©ment et al. (2005) reported experimental results on a new ETA solar cell fabricated from an electron-accepting layer of free-standing ZnO nanowires. Law et al. (2005) presented first the ordered nanowire DSSC. The nanowire DSSC is an exciting variant of the most successful of the excitonic photovoltaic devices. As an ordered topology that increases the rate of electron transport, a nanowire electrode may provide a means to improve the quantum efficiency of DSSCs in the red region of the spectrum, where their performance is currently limited. Raising the efficiency of the nanowire cell to a competitive level depends on achieving higher dye loadings through an increase in surface area. Law et al. (2006) described the construction and performance of DSSCs based on arrays of ZnO nanowires coated with thin shells of amorphous Al2O3 or anatase TiO2 by atomic layer deposition.",journal of electrical & electronic systems,['2332-0796'],journal,0,[],Zhang,,False,

The predictions showed that films of InBi could be applicable in quantum computers and at room temperature. The common approach of realizing such a structure, by growing InAsBi films, has not been successful, as the Bi content has been far too low for the properties of interest to emerge.

The work presented in this thesis explores an alternative approach to forming the InBi films – with a clean InAs(110) sample as a starting point. Bi is deposited onto the sample via thermal evaporation, keeping the sample at room temperature. If successful, the Bi atoms are believed to undergo an exchange process where they replace the exposed As atoms in the lattice. This would, in turn, enable us to facilitate a higher and more homogeneous Bi incorporation as well as providing an atomically sharp interface between the top layer and the rest of the substrate. The main goal was, therefore, to determine whether the Bi atoms would be incorporated into the host lattice via the Bi-for-As exchange process, or if they would be desorbed and leave the surface. The idea of the exchange process is supported by the previous work on Sb deposition on GaAs and InAs nanowires.

The InAs(110) sample, and the effect of the Bi deposition approach, was studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By studying the STM images taken, it became evident that the deposited Bi atoms formed monolayer high islands that had a larger rectangular structure than the underlying substrate. Furthermore, the unit cell of the Bi structure was rotated 35.4° clockwise relative to the InAs(110) unit cell. The different structure, as compared to the substrate, indicated that the islands were metallic Bi.

After the Bi deposition, the InAs(110) sample was annealed. However, with only STM to study the sample, it was difficult to tell whether most of the Bi atoms were desorbed from the surface, exposing a much rougher InAs(110) surface, or, if the Bi had been incorporated either as InBi or InAs_(x)Bi_(1−x).",,,,0,[],Alpskog,,False,

SnS2 with hexagonal crystal structure has unique characteristics including high carrier mobility[4], fast photo response[5], good photo catalytical activities & high optical absorption[6]. Lateral or vertical heterostructure of SnS2 with graphene[7],[8] or other 2D materials has many potential applications such as high charge storage capacity, stability, electrodes with long life for ion batteries. Whereas SnS which is one of the polytype of SnS2 is a p-type semiconductor with an orthorhombic crystal structure. SnS is also an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.08 -1.74 eV. SnS can be considered as a good candidate for solar cell applications as its band gap is near to an optimum value of 1.5 eV for maximum solar radiation absorption. SnS2 is a promising candidate for lithium/sodium ion batteries, solar cells, sensors, photodetector, field effect transistor applications[9],[10]. Despite its unique optoelectronic applications, SnS2 has been rarely studied.
Here our main objective is to fabricate SnS2 using various deposition techniques like physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and device fabrication with hetero stacking of other 2D materials. We co-evaporate Sn with S in CVD which is a bottom-up approach, schematic is shown in figure (1a). Hetero stacking can be done in CVD by choosing the required precursors & by monitoring the growth parameters.

On exposure to HMs, severe health problems can be occurring such as central nervous system failure, neurodegenerative diseases, respiratory, gastric, and cardiovascular systems. In soil, HMs affect the enzyme's function, inhibit the growth of the microbial community, and overall deteriorate the soil quality [3]. Therefore, detection of HMs is essential, for which various developed techniques are atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and flame atomic absorption spectrometry but all these techniques are sophisticated, costly, and require trained personnel to perform.

A composite of alanine, reduced graphene oxide, and polydopamine (ALA/rGO/pDA) was used for the first time in the HMs detection. Alanine has an excellent binding capability with metal ions and forms chelate; polydopamine is rich in functional group such as amine and catechol which possess strong binding affinity, it also helps to improve the performance of material and in covalent conjugation.

Like other two-dimensional (2D) materials, Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) can be stacked as heterostructures for 2D electronics [2]. Transition metal oxides contain a massive family of materials that performance a variety of extraordinary properties that are attractive for many applications [3]. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) such as MoO3 have been researched for so many years due to their stunning applications in electronics, gas sensors, Light-emitting diode  (LEDs), photo, electrochromic materials, and so on. In this work, we have carried out two types of synthesis on nanostructures of molybdenum trioxides. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) can be appeared in varied crystal structures like orthorhombic (α-MoO3), monoclinic (β- MoO3) and hexagonal (h- MoO3). When compared with other phases, Orthorhombic (α-MoO3) is more stable thermodynamically also maintains a unique layered structure and in each of its layers, the octahedra MoO6 consists of two sub-layers interconnected in (101) direction [4]. β- MoO3 is the metastable phase that is transformed into the α-phase by heating above 673K. The unit cell parameters of α- MoO3 a=0.37 nm, b=0.36 nm, c=1.229 nm (α=β=δ=900) and for β-MoO3 is a=0.77 nm, b=0.74 nm, c=1.09 nm (α=β= 900, δ=1200) [5]. We can use a hot plate and chemical vapor deposition. This method will give multilayers of MoO3 on graphene/SiO2 and graphene/glass as a substrate with temperature variations. Hot plate and Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can be done in ambient conditions.
 
The chemical vapor deposition (CARBOLITE GERO 30-30000C) was utilized to grow α-MoO3. The deposited Mo thin films on Sputtering are used as a source and place graphene/SiO2 as a substrate upside down to source in Quartz tube. The detailed information of tube is 1m length and inner diameter 5.5 cm and outer diameter 5.9 cm containing 0.2 cm thickness of tube in the furnace. We have three zones in CVD, in that three zones, the middle zone has gas flow parameters of Argon (Ar), Oxygen (O2), Carbon dioxide (CO2), Nitrogen (N2). First, MoO3 form on the source and become like α-MoO3. Later α-MoO3 will be evaporated from temp 6500C. Fig.1 shows the arrangement of the source and substrate in a quartz tube, and how it forms on the substrate in CVD. Argon and Oxygen gases pursuing with 1L/min and 2L/min held for 30mins at 6500C. We get α-MoO3 nanosheets on Substrate.
 
An alternate method to grow α-MoO3 is a hotplate. (iStir HP 5500C) was utilized to grow α-MoO3. In this case, also, we have used the sputter-deposited Mo film as the source of Molybdenum. It was observed that the Hotplate method produced a large area and faster growth compared to CVD-grown samples.
 
The characterization of α-MoO3 was studied in X-ray diffraction (XRD), Glancing incidence  X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), UV-VIS bandgap, Raman spectroscopy, Impedance spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), may give the information of crystal structure, impedance, orientation, surface morphology, bandgap and optical images of α-MoO3.

It is due to the unique catalytic, electronic, magnetic, optoelectronic and mechanical properties. So, these nano-sized materials can be applied in several fields such as chemistry, sensors, biotechnology, electronics and so on.
Nowadays, nanotechnology research based on nanoporous materials synthesized by electrochemical techniques, such as nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) is one of the most active. NAA manufactured by aluminium substrates anodization owns exceptional chemical, optical and mechanical properties, for example, chemical resistance, thermal stability, hardness, biocompatibility and large specific surface area. NAA is an excellent platform to develop sophisticated and relevant applications as selective molecular separation, chemical/biological sensing, catalysis, cell adhesion and culture, data storage, energy generation and storage, drug delivery and template synthesis.
NAA technology has evolved as one of the major topics in science today, offering exciting novel opportunities in the field of renewable energy manufacturing/conversion and storage. Focusing on the use of NAA as energy generation devices, it is essential that these devices also meet similar requisites of sustainability and efficiency, making the entire process of generation and consumption of energy as clean as possible.
On the other hand, currently, about 80% of global energy consumption, which includes providing 65% of global electricity generation originates from fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas). If society does not perform rapidly to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) released through the burning of fossil fuels, we will face disastrous consequences. Decreasing our need for these energy sources by switching to renewable sources like wind and solar, will let a noteworthy lessening in carbon emissions. Luckily, humanity is more and more becomes aware of the use of sustainable energy sources that keep the environment, such as solar energy.
The Sun is t he principal source of visible light and the most important source of radiant energy that hits the Earth. The total solar irradiance hitting the top of the Earth's atmosphere is around 1361 W/m2. This energy can be used by plants for the process of photosynthesis, for heating and for generating electricity. Currently, solar energy is one of the most significant renewable energy for achieving a sustainable future.
Due to the large absorption coefficient, suitable bandgap, excellent crystallinity and long carrier diffusion length of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), in the past years, they have drawn great research attention because for photovoltaic (PV) applications. 
To decide the viability of the commercialization of PV technology, three factors are typically considered: cost, efficiency and stability. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a PV device is a measure of the percentage of light incident upon it that is converted into usable electricity. Perovskiter solar cell (PSCs) are predicted to be low-cost since their low material and fabrication costs. In a few years, its PCE almost reaches the value of silicon solar cells. PSCs efficiencies have increased from 2.2% in 2006 to 25.2% in 2020.However, stability still requires further development. 
This thesis aim is focused on the use of NAA technology to develop nanostructured perovskite solar cells. NAA will provide the advantage of enhancing perovskite stability since the perovskite layer will be surrounded by the other layers and the nanopore walls. Therefore, first, the familiarization process with the manufacture and characterization of NAA, as well as of high-efficiency PSCs, by known standard methods were conducted. 
NAA has not electric contact between the interior of the nanopores and the aluminium substrate. This is due to the as produce compact oxide layer (barrier layer) at the nanopore bottom. So, the first goal achieved is to remove this thick barrier layer under controlled anodization conditions. With this structural modification, electric contact between the aluminium of the NAA substrate and the possible infiltrated materials within the nanopores is reached.
Also, the objective of infiltrating the different materials that form the PCSs with a specific height and homogeneous among all the nanopores is studied and attained.
In this PhD essay, the design and fabrication of an energy generation device founded on nanostructured perovskite solar cells based on NAA technology are presented.
High-efficiency PSCs were first manufactured, using simple deposition methods: spin-coating and thermal evaporation. Most of these depositions were conducted in a N2-filled glovebox. The devices were characterized by the solar simulator (Abet Technologies model 11000 class type A, Xenon arc) and a Keithley 2400 Source-Measure Unit.
NAA was obtained by aluminium electrochemical anodization. The substrates were mainly characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy.
The nanostructured perovskite solar cells were also manufactured by simple deposition methods such as spin-coating, drop-casting and thermal evaporation. Besides, most of these depositions were conducted in a N2-filled glovebox.

Nanofilaments are formed and dissolved at pre-programmed locations with a conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM) using a custom script. Although the formation time generally decreases with increasing bias from 0.7 to 3.0 V, an unexpected non-monotonic maximum is observed ~2.0 V. At voltages approaching this region of inverted kinetics, IL electric double layers (EDLs) become detectable; thus, the increased nanofilament formation time can be attributed to electric field screening, which hinders silver electromigration and deposition. Scanning electron microscopy confirms that nanofilaments formed in this inverted region have significantly more lateral and diffuse features. Time dependent formation currents reveal two types of nanofilament growth dynamics: abrupt, where the resistance decreases sharply over as little as a few ms, and gradual where it decreases more slowly over hundreds of ms. Whether the resistance change is abrupt or gradual depends on the extent to which the EDL screens the electric field. Silver nanofilaments with gradual growth dynamics have potential application in neuromorphic computing. In this study, a linear (R2 > 0.9) dependence of conductance on the number of bias pulses is demonstrated—a signature feature that is required for neuromorphic application. Hundreds of distinguishable conductance states ranging from 235 to 260 microsimens can be accessed using a low read bias. These results show that novel PEGDA/IL composite electrolyte enables the gradual formation and dissolution of silver nanofilament with tunable conductance states, making it a promising candidate to advance neuromorphic applications.",,,,0,[],Chao,,False,

Specifically, a-C films have widespread applications as protective coatings in mechanical parts, biomedical instruments, microelectromechanical devices and magnetic recording, because of their high hardness and excellent chemical inertness. At present, the urgent demands for higher data areal density in magnetic recording industry have generated high interest in acquiring fundamental understanding of the structure and properties of a-C ultrathin films. The most promising magnetic recording technique to achieve higher data areal density is heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). HAMR solves a critical problem in high data areal density or high data stability associated with the superparamagnetic limit. In HAMR, an integrated optical system is used to focus a laser beam to a sub-diffraction-limit spot in order to locally heat the magnetic media above its Curie temperature, thus enabling data writing in the fine-grained, high-magnetic-anisotropy magnetic media that allows both high data areal density and data stability. The incorporation of laser heating in magnetic recording creates a major challenge, i.e., the durability and stability of ultrathin a-C films (a few nanometers thick) under high temperature. Thus, the principal objective of this dissertation is to address the thermomechanical, electromagnetic, and material issues relevant to a-C films used in HAMR technology. Device-level simulations using the finite element method (FEM) were performed to elucidate the heat transfer process in HAMR. The thermal protrusion and the surface temperature distribution in a typical HAMR head under various heat sources and read/write conditions were examined to understand the near-field heat transfer at the head/disk interface. The effects of material optical properties of various stack layers on the thermo-plasmonic performance of a HAMR head/disk stack were also investigated. The device-level simulations provide insight into the unique heat transfer process in HAMR and an effective means of tuning the optical properties of stacking layers in HAMR devices to optimize their energy transmission performance. After obtaining the representative temperature distribution in a HAMR device via the device-level simulations, the thermal stability and diffusion characteristics of a-C films were studied experimentally. The growth and thermal stability of ultrathin a-C films synthesized by filtered cathodic vacuum arc on pure Si and a SiNx layer formed by Si nitrogenation using radio-frequency sputtering were investigated. The samples were thermally annealed for various durations and subsequently characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The HRTEM images confirmed the continuity and uniformity of the a-C films and the morphology of the SiNx underlayer. The EELS analysis of cross-sectional samples revealed the thermal stability of the a-C films and the efficacy of the SiNx underlayer to prevent carbon migration into the Si substrate. Despite several experimental studies of the thermal stability of a-C films, basic understanding of the structure evolution of ultrathin a-C films during film growth and heating is highly empirical, presumably due to the lack of high-resolution instruments that can probe structural changes at the atomic level in real time. Thus, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that provided insight into changes in the structure of ultrathin a-C films during deposition and annealing were performed. Simulation results revealed a multi-layer film structure, even for a-C films as thin as ~20 A, the existence of a deposition energy that yields a-C films with the highest sp³ content, the transient and steady-state stages of the structure evolution during annealing at different temperatures, and insight into the changes in the hybridization state encountered during annealing. The correlation between internal stress, film structure, and temperature in ultrathin a-C films was also analyzed by MD. The physical mechanisms of a-C film growth and stress built-up under energetic particle bombardment and stress relief due to thermal annealing were examined. Simulations of film growth revealed a correlation between internal stress and energy of incident carbon atoms. A significant stress relief was observed mainly in the bulk layer of the multilayered a-C film structure at a critical annealing temperature, which intensified with the further increase of the temperature. Besides a high temperature, a-C films may experience oxidation and sliding contact during operation. MD simulations of oxidation and sliding of a-C films were performed to elucidate the oxidation and tribo-oxidation processes of the films in the presence of oxygen. The simulations demonstrated oxygen kinetic energy thresholds for continuous carbon loss and for oxygen surface adsorption saturation, a surface dominated oxidation process, significant interfacial adhesion of the active film surface and significant changes of the tribological behavior and film structure during sliding. Tribo-induced a-C film oxidation was observed in sliding simulations with surface oxygen adsorption. Graphene is another carbon form that shows outstanding mechanical properties and a high potential as a protective and lubricious coating in various industrial applications. In this dissertation, the synthesis of graphene on a-C films was explored and a facile single-step synthesis method for fabricating thin a-C layers containing graphitic structures was developed. By annealing thin-film stacks of Si/NiFe/a-C, a thin layer with a hybrid a-C-planar graphene (PG)-orbicular graphitic carbon (OGC) structure was produced. Raman spectroscopy and cross-sectional TEM confirmed the transformation from amorphous to graphitic structure in the a-C film during thermal annealing. The obtained results indicated that the development of this hybrid a-C-PG-OGC microstructure is due to a metal-catalyzed PG nucleation mechanism and a mismatch-induced OGC growth mechanism.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1976156302', 'https://openalex.org/W1988133629', 'https://openalex.org/W1990309441', 'https://openalex.org/W1998560175', 'https://openalex.org/W2002801138', 'https://openalex.org/W2002915486', 'https://openalex.org/W2009607931', 'https://openalex.org/W2014511798', 'https://openalex.org/W2014935324', 'https://openalex.org/W2015917682', 'https://openalex.org/W2025666491', 'https://openalex.org/W2027532957', 'https://openalex.org/W2033715030', 'https://openalex.org/W2035497069', 'https://openalex.org/W2039998003', 'https://openalex.org/W2054761688', 'https://openalex.org/W2062913845', 'https://openalex.org/W2072836371', 'https://openalex.org/W2074120039', 'https://openalex.org/W2075820124', 'https://openalex.org/W2081769863', 'https://openalex.org/W2089934023', 'https://openalex.org/W2092188263', 'https://openalex.org/W2094728047', 'https://openalex.org/W2108337913', 'https://openalex.org/W2110683807', 'https://openalex.org/W2125612486', 'https://openalex.org/W2128654538', 'https://openalex.org/W2134233006', 'https://openalex.org/W2153552041', 'https://openalex.org/W2163838939', 'https://openalex.org/W2236242332', 'https://openalex.org/W2267081055', 'https://openalex.org/W2299163236', 'https://openalex.org/W2469468328', 'https://openalex.org/W2572110264', 'https://openalex.org/W2579213255', 'https://openalex.org/W2791007557', 'https://openalex.org/W2800503532', 'https://openalex.org/W2809307297', 'https://openalex.org/W2809384676', 'https://openalex.org/W2980957926', 'https://openalex.org/W2996705981', 'https://openalex.org/W2999897280', 'https://openalex.org/W3025400023', 'https://openalex.org/W3099391573']",Wang,,False,

Currently, the growth of large area TMDs thin films/flakes is one of the biggest challenges. A novel method for the growth of ultra-thin and large area tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer flakes has been developed by introducing a solution-based temperature-dependent process. This two-dimensional WS2 growth process is low cost and environmentally friendly. Ammonium tetrathiotungstate ((NH4)2WS4, ATTW) was used as WS2 precursor. The process requires a moderate activation temperature as no flakes are formed at room temperature. Successful growth of flakes was observed in an aqueous solution of the precursor at a temperature between 70 and 90 oC. These flakes could be transferred to any substrate by a controlled dip-coating process. Large 2D WS2 flakes with a lateral size of up to 100 μm were obtained. The thickness ranged from a WS2 monolayer to five monolayers, as verified by AFM. 
Similarly, large area molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) ultra-thin film deposition is one of the big challenges in the recent years. Electrodeposition provides an opportunity to grow such ultra-thin films on large scale. However, the transfer of the electrochemically grown film to desired substrate is challenging. In this work, the polymer coated electrodeposited MoS2 films on Au are separated mechanically from the underlying substrate by using ultra-sonication. Collapse of micron-sized bubbles produced by ultra-sonication at the interface of Au and silicon substrate provides enough energy for separation due to their weak adhesion. The Au layer is then removed by standard Au-etchant (K/KI) and the polymer coated MoS2 film (two monolayers) is transferred to a desired substrate.
The obtained MoS2 films by electrodeposition and spin coating were also used for hydrogen evolution reaction. The HER activity measurements for electrodeposited MoS2 showed an overpotential for 30 nm thick MoS2 of -0.33 V, whereas for smaller thicknesses below 10 nm a value of -0.22 V was found. This indicates that ultra-thin films of MoS2 show a better HER activity than thick films. The obtained Tafel slope of 44 mV per decade for 5 nm MoS2 is better than values reported for single crystal MoS2 and other 2D materials such as WS2.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1974896731', 'https://openalex.org/W1983739557', 'https://openalex.org/W1987253619', 'https://openalex.org/W1987700371', 'https://openalex.org/W1992214743', 'https://openalex.org/W1993455780', 'https://openalex.org/W2007657053', 'https://openalex.org/W2010640560', 'https://openalex.org/W2015690888', 'https://openalex.org/W2017871657', 'https://openalex.org/W2019307036', 'https://openalex.org/W2019357920', 'https://openalex.org/W2031017899', 'https://openalex.org/W2040189193', 'https://openalex.org/W2043775186', 'https://openalex.org/W2045988635', 'https://openalex.org/W2048610167', 'https://openalex.org/W2074388474', 'https://openalex.org/W2078204579', 'https://openalex.org/W2080976110', 'https://openalex.org/W2085895639', 'https://openalex.org/W2091061711', 'https://openalex.org/W2108086987', 'https://openalex.org/W2108333556', 'https://openalex.org/W2115786064', 'https://openalex.org/W2117199849', 'https://openalex.org/W2125284466', 'https://openalex.org/W2135175049', 'https://openalex.org/W2139088889', 'https://openalex.org/W2299291610', 'https://openalex.org/W2306757740', 'https://openalex.org/W2319419256', 'https://openalex.org/W2323627322', 'https://openalex.org/W2333365892', 'https://openalex.org/W2473750336', 'https://openalex.org/W2505736583', 'https://openalex.org/W2558659093', 'https://openalex.org/W2566343410', 'https://openalex.org/W2605524739', 'https://openalex.org/W2611470961', 'https://openalex.org/W2618411746', 'https://openalex.org/W2647993184', 'https://openalex.org/W2761691118', 'https://openalex.org/W2790792256', 'https://openalex.org/W2895621060', 'https://openalex.org/W2895886847', 'https://openalex.org/W2944826880', 'https://openalex.org/W2946327257', 'https://openalex.org/W2960146287', 'https://openalex.org/W2964553691', 'https://openalex.org/W2972622705', 'https://openalex.org/W2974853668', 'https://openalex.org/W2987350845', 'https://openalex.org/W2996898441', 'https://openalex.org/W3006469803', 'https://openalex.org/W3035444287', 'https://openalex.org/W3101929953', 'https://openalex.org/W3105773174', 'https://openalex.org/W3203992401']",Nisar,,False,

Domtau,"Photocurrent, Absorbance, Carbon fibers","Light harvesting efficiency in dye sensitized solar cell is currently enhanced by the employment of an additional TiO2 scattering layer hence increasing the overall film thickness. This has limitations on effective charge transport especially in dense electrolyte media due to the increased film thickness. The additional film layer further reduces light intensity on the adsorbed dye hence decreasing photocurrent generation. Therefore, there is still the challenge of light scattering optimization versus charge transport and photocurrent generation. In addition, though TiO2 is a relatively cheap material, the addition of TiO2 layer raises the production cost of the dye sensitized solar cell effectively and rendering it not cost effective. In this study, carbon black was employed to create artificial pores in TiO2 thin films to enhance light harvesting and hence photocurrent generation. TiO2 films deposited by screen printing method had 0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 wt% carbon black. On annealing of the films at 500oC in air for 30 minutes, carbon black decomposed leaving behind voids. Transmittance, reflectance and absorbance spectra of the films determined by a UV-Vis-NIR show that transmittance decreased as the carbon black concentration increased. On the other hand, both reflectance and absorbance increased with increase in carbon black concentration. Micrograph images obtained from both Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) show that the pore size of the films increased as the carbon black concentration increased. 

Furthermore, the XRD results of these films show that the TiO2 are anatase and without any carbon contamination. Conductivity of the films determined using a four point probe was found to decrease with increase in pore size due to decrease in electrical contacts among the TiO2 molecules. The values 384.61, 352.11, 103.41, 52.41 and 35.29 Siemen’s cm-1 were determined for 0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0, respectively. Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics of the cell fabricated with different pore sizes were determined using a solar cell simulator at 100 mW/cm2 illumination. The results show that photocurrent generated by these cells increased from 6.1 mA/cm2 to a maximum value of 9.9 mA/cm2 as the wt % carbon black increased from 0 wt% to 1.5 wt %, respectively. Beyond 1.5 wt%, photocurrent begun to drop until it got to its minimum value of 4.7 mA/cm2 at 3.0 wt%. The overall efficiencies for 0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 wt% were found to be 2.3, 2.6, 4.3, 2.4 and 1.4 %, respectively. The result shows an improvement in the photovoltaic performance of DSSC as a result of the artificial voids created. However, beyond the optimum concentration of 1.5 wt%, the cell performance begun to decline. This approach greatly enhanced the current density of the cells and consequently the overall conversion efficiency significantly.

Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) rely on the absorption of photons by the dye molecules which are transported to the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode. The microstructure, energy gap and the absorption spectra of the TiO2 electrodes highly affects the efficiency of the cell. In this paper, the absorption spectra and energy gap has been studied by varying the thickness of the TiO2 paste. Nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films were deposited on ITO glass substrate with three different thickness (4.54µm, 7.12µm and 12.3µm) by using doctor blade method. After deposition all the samples were sintered at 450E?C after deposition to enhance the particle bonding and for achieving better adhesion. The samples were characterized by UV-VIS spectra for determining the absorption spectra and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for investigating the thickness and the surface morphology. Fabricating the electrodes with different thickness showed significant changes in the energy gap and from the results it can be concluded that the energy gap increases with the increased thickness. The highest energy gap of 2.25ev and absorption 3.791 was achieved by 12.3µm thick sample. The absorption spectra also shows better absorption throughout the whole visible light range but the SEM images suggests that 12.3µm thick sample shows cracks all over the deposited region which will cause current leakage when the cell is assembled. Therefore, the optimum result was achieved by 7.12µm thick sample providing 1.9 ev energy gap and 3.91 absorption peak. 

DSSCs has been accepted widely to be used as potential solar cell apart from traditional solid-state cells. It is considered as photo electrochemical solar cell that consists of mesoporous metal oxide semiconductor layer on transparent conductive glass, which is used as working electrode [1]. Other major components are the organic or inorganic dye material, electrolyte and the counter electrode. Oxide semiconductors possess decent stability under irradiation but due to the large bandgap this kind of material cannot absorb visible light directly [2]. In case of dye-sensitized solar cell, TiO2 is mostly used as the oxide semiconductor having 3.2ev energy gap [3]. To recover the absorption issue organic/inorganic dyes are used to sensitize the TiO2 based electrode. Dyes help to excite the electrons received from the sunlight to change its state and upon excitation; the dye molecule injects the electron towards the conduction band of the TiO2 based electrode. The semiconductor electrode then transports the electron to external load. The efficiency of this kind of solar cell highly affected depending on the performance of the TiO2 coated electrode [4]. The TiO2 paste formulation is very crucial since it helps to adsorb large amount of dye molecule to the 2 1234567890‘’“” ICAMME 2017 IOP Publishing IOP Conf.

2018,2043,https://openalex.org/W3015026098,,high-q strong coupling capacitive-gap transduced rf micromechanical resonators,article,2020-01-01,2020,,,,,Alper Ozgurluk,"Stopband, Passband","Author(s): Ozgurluk, Alper | Advisor(s): Nguyen, Clark T.-C. | Abstract: This dissertation presents a hierarchical, intuitive, and technology agnostic procedure for design-ing RF channel-select filters, followed by an actual demonstration solidly confirming the validity of the design method. Two distinct methods then follow that aim to increase the resonator electrome-chanical coupling coefficient, which substantially improves the functionality of the demonstrated filter for future applications, e.g., ones that require higher-order with sharper roll-off characteristics and less passband ripple. To increase functionality even further, the remaining chapters of this the-sis introduce a fabrication and post-processing method using CMOS-compatible ruthenium metal that allows integration of micromechanical devices, such as the aforementioned RF filters, atop CMOS.Chapter 2 introduces design, fabrication, and experimental demonstration of a differential in-put/output RF channel-select micromechanical disk filter consisting of 96 mechanically coupled capacitive-gap-transduced polysilicon disk resonators, centered at 224MHz with only 0.1% (9kHz) bandwidth, all while attaining 2.7dB insertion loss and more than 50dB out-of-channel stopband rejection. Combined with inherent high-Q’s of capacitive-gap disk resonators, sub-40nm transduc-tion gaps enabled by the sidewall sacrificial layer fabrication technology and defensive design strat-egies employing buffer disks against fabrication residual stress were instrumental in obtaining this impressive performance with decent yield and RF-compatible 590 filter termination impedance. Perhaps most encouraging, the equivalent circuit model developed for this complicated structure based on mechanical and electrical parameters was spot on in capturing not only the ideal filter re-sponse, but also the parasitic nonidealities that might distort the filter performance. Having presented an initial RF channel-select filter demonstration, Chapters 3-5 then focus on design methods and fabrication techniques that could raise the filter performance one step further by substantially increasing the electromechanical coupling coefficient of its constituent resonators. Specifically, Chapter 3 introduces a new type of a resonator formed via hollowing out a capacitive-gap transduced radial mode disk resonator that achieved a measured electromechanical coupling strength (Cx/Co) of 0.75% at 123 MHz without the need to scale the device’s meager 40-nm elec-trode-to-resonator gap. This is almost 7× improvement in Cx/Co compared with a conventional ra-dial contour-mode disk at the same frequency, same dc bias, and same gap. Cx/Co increases like this should improve the passbands of channel-select filters targeted for low power wireless trans-ceivers, as well as lower the power consumption of MEMS-based oscillators.Considering the dependence of the electromechanical coupling on the actuation gap is inverse cubic compared to the linear dependence on mass, Chapters 4-5 attempt to obtain strong coupling by reducing the actuation gaps to below 10nm from their current 37nm. To realize this, one must first overcome fabrication-related hurdles such as precise thin film residual stress control, smooth post-etch sidewalls free of asperities, and sub-10nm sacrificial layer conformal deposition. Chapter 4 attacks the first hurdle by introducing an on-chip strain measurement device that harnesses preci-sion frequency measurement to precisely extract sub-nm displacements, allowing it to determine the residual strain in a given structural film with best-in-class accuracy, where stress as small as 15MPa corresponds to 2.9nm of displacement. The importance of attaining such accuracy mani-fests in the fact that knowledge of residual strain might be the single most important constraint on the complexity of large mechanical circuits, such as RF channel-select filters.Chapter 5 then addresses the remaining hurdles for achieving sub-10nm gaps by using a modi-fied polysilicon etch recipe that generates considerably smoother sidewalls and an atomic layer de-posited (ALD) 8nm-thick conformal SiO2 sidewall sacrificial layer. The single-digit-nanometer electrode-to-resonator gaps demonstrated in this chapter have enabled 200-MHz radial-contour mode polysilicon disk resonators with motional resistance Rx as low as 144 while still posting Q’s exceeding 10,000, all with only 2.5V dc-bias. The tiny motional resistance, together with (Cx/Co)’s up to 1% at 4.7V dc-bias and (Cx/Co)-Q products exceeding 100, propel polysilicon ca-pacitive-gap transduced resonator technology to the forefront of MEMS resonator applications that put a premium on noise performance, such as radar oscillators. Simultaneous high-Q and strong electromechanical coupling (Cx/Co) makes this technology attractive for future sharp roll-off, flat passband RF channel-select filters targeted for low power receivers as well as wide band filters targeted for the LTE bands.The decent resonator performance offered by polysilicon structural material with Q’s exceeding 10,000 at 200MHz comes with a drawback that LPCVD polysilicon with deposition temperatures of 590-615C is not directly integrable atop CMOS due to thermal budget constraints. Pursuant to mitigating this issue, Chapter 6 introduces a fabrication and post-processing method using CMOS-compatible ruthenium metal that allows integration of micromechanical devices atop CMOS. Spe-cifically, introduction of tensile stress via localized Joule heating has yielded some of the highest metal MEMS resonator Q’s measured to date, as high as 48,919 for a 12-MHz ruthenium micro-mechanical clamped-clamped beam. The low-temperature ruthenium metal process, with highest temperature of 450°C and paths to an even lower ceiling of 200°C, further allows for MEMS pro-cessing over CMOS wafers offering a promising route towards monolithic realization of CMOS-MEMS circuits needed in communication transceivers.Finally, Chapter 7 fulfills the promise of this dissertation in metals, i.e., simultaneous high-Q and strong coupling, by employing a 20-nm-gap CMOS-compatible flexural-mode square-plate resonator constructed in thermal-annealed ruthenium metal that posts quality factors (Q’s) exceed-ing 5,000 and an impressive transducer strength Cx/Co (equivalent to kt2) of up to 71% intrinsic and 36% with 55fF of bond capacitance loading, which in turn permits more than 46% voltage-controlled resonance frequency tuning (from 18.005 to 9.713MHz) with a voltage excursion from 0.5 to 2.8V. The 36% Cx/Co is 75 times larger than the 0.48% of published AlN piezoelectric mate-rial in this HF frequency range. With processing temperatures potentially below 350°C (using lo-calized annealing), this metal resonator is amenable to integration directly over even advanced node CMOS, making this technology attractive for single-chip widely tunable filter and oscillator appli-cations, e.g., for wireless communications.",,,,0,[],Ozgurluk,,False,
2019,2044,https://openalex.org/W3214634147,,study of biological interactions between water dispersed 2d-mos2 nanosheets and live matter,article,2020-03-13,2020,,,,,Manjot Singh,Living matter,"The unique two dimensional structure and fascinating physicochemical properties of two dimensional materials (2D) have attracted tremendous attention worldwide in disease diagnosis and nano-biomedicine. As an analogue of 2D graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as 2D MoS2/WS2 nanosheets have been exploited as representative models in numerous applications ranging from nanoelectronics to the frontiers between nanomedicine and nanotechnology. The intriguing physical and chemical properties of 2D TMDs such as confinement in dimension due to their extreme thinness, stable free standing atomic crystal nanosheets without any substrate, unparalleled surface area to volume ratio, highly biocompatible and flexibility in functionalization with different biological molecules makes them potentially favorable candidate for many biomedical applications. 
To get an insight into the biological and environmental fate of these engineered 2D nanosheets, it is very crucial to understand the nano-bio interactions at a prior level. Basically, the biological response to 2D nanomaterials is governed by material-specific behavior which further can be understood by the fundamental physicochemical properties of that material. Generally, three fundamental interaction modes are studied to analyze the biological impact of a given nanomaterial: a) chemical interactions, b) electronic and surface redox reactions and c) very unique physical and mechanical interactions. In general, 2DMs have shown wide range of behaviors with respect to these three modes of interactions at bio-nanosheet interface studies. Among these three modes, physical and mechanical interaction represents a unique way to study the biological response of 2D TMD nanosheets because of their high surface area to volume ratio, surface charge tuning and polarity. To exploit the full potential of 2D TMD nanosheets in biological applications, it is highly required that the given nanomaterial to be highly biocompatible, reproducible in the relevant physiological medium, flexibility in functionalization and with minimum cytotoxicity to the normal cells. In such a case and from the materials perspective, highly versatile, scalable, cost efficient and green fabrication techniques are required to obtain 2D nanosheets with the desired properties. To accomplish this aim, among various fabrication techniques reported for 2D TMDs such as chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical exfoliation, lithium intercalation, hydrothermal, sol-gel and liquid phase exfoliation, the latter one is the most versatile, scalable and cost effective technique for the production of few-layer nanosheets (1–10 stacked monolayers), with low monolayer content. Particularly in this technique, a careful optimization of exfoliation parameters such as, choice of green solvents, initial concentration of the solution, exfoliation time and controlled centrifugation for size and thickness selection of 2D nanosheets is very crucial to understand their environmental impact and behavior in biological media.
 To this aim, my PhD project is focused on the noticeable progress on green and scalable production of MoS2 nanosheets in water as a pure solvent, having stability up to three weeks or more by carefully optimizing critical exfoliation parameters. Such a long stability time in water, which is a non-trivial result, is crucial to test the impact of 2DMs with biological live matter in its native context, as experiments aimed at these goals may take a few days or even longer to be completed. Thus, we stress that our innovative preparation of naked MoS2 nanosheets in water solvent represents an essential step ahead for an appropriate characterization of 2DMs – live matter interactions in its natural environment. 
Till date, our group has investigated the biological interactions of bare MoS2 nanosheets with three different kinds of human cells, two tumoral, MCF7 (breast cancer) and U937 (leukemia), and one normal, HaCaT (epithelium), and two different kinds of Salmonella- ATCC 14028 and wild type S.typhimurium. It is worth noting that while MCF, and HaCaT cells have been already partly investigated with respect to their interactions with MoS2 nanosheets, U937-MoS2 interactions are completely unknown so far. Yet, MCF7 (Breast Cancer), Hela (Human Cervical Cancer), PC3 (Human Prostate Cancer), SMCC-7721 (Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma), B16 (Mouse Melanoma) and A549 (Human Lung Carcinoma) as cancer cell lines have been also recently tested as models by other research groups for the interactions between human cells and 2D functionalized nanomaterials of various composition, there including 2D Black Phosphorus nanosheets, 2D Boron nanosheets, 2D Antimonene quantum dots, 2D Antimonene nanosheets and Tin Sulfide nanosheets. 
Here, we found a very interesting and novel result from our experiments: the impact of MoS2 nanoflakes was found to be quite different in normal from cancer cell lines. While the latter cells revealed a significant cytotoxic effect based on a very large increase of cell death, the former were essentially unaffected in this respect and only showed some mechanical damage when morphologically analyzed by SEM microscopy. This cytotoxic effect was also found to be dependent on the concentration and layer number of 2D nanoflakes. In the near future, this preliminary analysis might open up new routes for significant applications of MoS2 nanosheets as targeted anti-cancer systems. This analysis was further extended to bacteria and viruses. Particularly, we have investigated the mechanical interaction of 2D MoS2 nanoflakes with two different types of Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028 and wild-type) which is a very serious Gram negative facultative anaerobe causing gastroenteritis in humans and in some cases it also results in serious neurological abnormalities with very high mortality rate. SEM analysis performed after the incubation of the complex system revealed significant damage to the bacterial morphology and leakage of intra-cellular components from the bacterial structure. Both of the salmonella types when treated with 2D MoS2 nanosheets, showed that the sharp edges of the nanoflakes can cut and/or damage bacterial membrane leading to an evident bactericidal effect. 
Additionally, with a motive to deposit MoS2 nanosheets onto a patterned or machined substrate, particularly silicon because of its widely explored technological significance and usage in various laser processing techniques, we have first investigated the surface structuring of silicon using femtosecond laser pulses with a broad range of repetition rates (10 Hz – 200 kHz). Careful selection of various experimental conditions results in the formation of surface patterns which paves the way for numerous interesting applications. In view of this, I have introduced some preliminary results of LPE exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets deposited onto patterned silicon substrate for investigating non-linear optics of 2D nanosheets based on their thickness and given lateral size, in ongoing projects chapter at the end of this thesis. 
Also, enthused from the synergistic impact of 2D MoS2 nanosheets on S. typhimurium, we are currently investigating the potential interaction of the same on two other types of bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). In this ongoing research, we have achieved a significant time and concentration dependent damage to bacterial morphology tested at different points. We have also extended our study to analyze the mechanical interaction of water exfoliated 2D MoS2 nanosheets on a very commonly effected contagious virus, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1), which has shown a good percentage of virus inhibition treated with water exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets. In fact, further investigations are under study and some of the preliminary results have been added into the ongoing projects chapter of this thesis.
In order to understand the specific mechanism of action of 2D MoS2 nanosheets on the already tested tumor and normal human cells in this thesis, we have further extended our analysis in another ongoing project to go into deeper insights of 2D MoS2 nanosheets - live matter interaction using advanced Raman microscopy technique. The cell viability and the subsequent Raman microscopic analysis performed on the MoS2 nanosheets incubated with the similar human cell lines (MCF-7, U937 and HaCaT) revealed noteworthy results confirming the specific action of MoS2 nanosheets on tumor cell line (MCF-7 and U937), whereas very little or negligible effect on normal cell line (HaCaT).",,,,0,[],Singh,,False,

Diwekar, Christos G. Takoudis",Deposition,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor-phase deposition technique that has attracted increasing attention from both experimentalists and theoreticians in the last few decades. ALD is well-known to produce conformal, uniform, and pinhole-free thin films across the surface of substrates. Due to these advantages, ALD has found many engineering and biomedical applications. However, drawbacks of ALD should be considered. For example, the reaction mechanisms cannot be thoroughly understood through experiments. Moreover, ALD conditions such as materials, pulse and purge durations, and temperature should be optimized for every experiment. It is practically impossible to perform many experiments to find materials and deposition conditions that achieve a thin film with desired applications. Additionally, only existing materials can be tested experimentally, which are often expensive and hazardous, and their use should be minimized. To overcome ALD limitations, theoretical methods are beneficial and essential complements to experimental data. Recently, theoretical approaches have been reported to model, predict, and optimize different ALD aspects, such as materials, mechanisms, and deposition characteristics. Those methods can be validated using a different theoretical approach or a few knowledge-based experiments.

Puurunen","Limiting, Atomic layer epitaxy, Deposition","Abstract Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a gas‐phase method to grow layers of solid materials with subnanometer precision. It has been invented independently in the Soviet Union in the 1960s under the name molecular layering, and in the 1970s in Finland under the name atomic layer epitaxy. ALD relies on alternatingly exposing a surface to gaseous reactants—separated by a purge step—that react in a self‐terminating manner. This article introduces the fundamentals of the surface chemistry of ideal ALD, including saturating and irreversible reactions, growth per cycle, monolayer concepts relevant to ALD, typical surface reaction mechanisms, saturation‐limiting factors, growth modes, area‐selective ALD, growth kinetics, and conformality. It also discusses typical deviations from ideal ALD. Over the years, many different ALD process chemistries have been developed. A range of reactor systems is available, depending on the type of substrate and required productivity. ALD is broadly applicable in practice since it couples nanoscale precision with a good scalability and can be used to deposit a large variety of materials. In recent years, the interest in ALD has been growing strongly. The most important sector regarding commercial applications of ALD is currently the semiconductor industry.",kirk-othmer encyclopedia of chemical technology,,journal,13,"['https://openalex.org/W1674526341', 'https://openalex.org/W1964022500', 'https://openalex.org/W1965368032', 'https://openalex.org/W1967749052', 'https://openalex.org/W1969413144', 'https://openalex.org/W1972256365', 'https://openalex.org/W1981130398', 'https://openalex.org/W1985038683', 'https://openalex.org/W1985569411', 'https://openalex.org/W1987134634', 'https://openalex.org/W1992568289', 'https://openalex.org/W1994546192', 'https://openalex.org/W1994978717', 'https://openalex.org/W1995191254', 'https://openalex.org/W1998534931', 'https://openalex.org/W2009569680', 'https://openalex.org/W2011091578', 'https://openalex.org/W2014242567', 'https://openalex.org/W2015878742', 'https://openalex.org/W2018152850', 'https://openalex.org/W2019143268', 'https://openalex.org/W2023603575', 'https://openalex.org/W2026609365', 'https://openalex.org/W2027302796', 'https://openalex.org/W2028789136', 'https://openalex.org/W2034620502', 'https://openalex.org/W2035931858', 'https://openalex.org/W2041680120', 'https://openalex.org/W2046709975', 'https://openalex.org/W2049812591', 'https://openalex.org/W2059705743', 'https://openalex.org/W2063058287', 'https://openalex.org/W2066863079', 'https://openalex.org/W2067952132', 'https://openalex.org/W2069760501', 'https://openalex.org/W2070653146', 'https://openalex.org/W2073817762', 'https://openalex.org/W2079447924', 'https://openalex.org/W2083309742', 'https://openalex.org/W2084951526', 'https://openalex.org/W2094245104', 'https://openalex.org/W2095169422', 'https://openalex.org/W2095567118', 'https://openalex.org/W2097405367', 'https://openalex.org/W2102458125', 'https://openalex.org/W2114113895', 'https://openalex.org/W2134261513', 'https://openalex.org/W2148331771', 'https://openalex.org/W2149248689', 'https://openalex.org/W2158453890', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701', 'https://openalex.org/W2167903456', 'https://openalex.org/W2171426616', 'https://openalex.org/W2175456191', 'https://openalex.org/W2257762244', 'https://openalex.org/W2279676767', 'https://openalex.org/W2325690438', 'https://openalex.org/W2327190127', 'https://openalex.org/W2333547160', 'https://openalex.org/W2491135105', 'https://openalex.org/W2509382493', 'https://openalex.org/W2516426840', 'https://openalex.org/W2527013643', 'https://openalex.org/W2527995625', 'https://openalex.org/W2557738395', 'https://openalex.org/W2561538511', 'https://openalex.org/W2562619559', 'https://openalex.org/W2586836119', 'https://openalex.org/W2602428918', 'https://openalex.org/W2658905278', 'https://openalex.org/W2755597807', 'https://openalex.org/W2767004806', 'https://openalex.org/W2775191300', 'https://openalex.org/W2783656427', 'https://openalex.org/W2791994412', 'https://openalex.org/W2793840258', 'https://openalex.org/W2801985588', 'https://openalex.org/W2802127740', 'https://openalex.org/W2804052433', 'https://openalex.org/W2862157488', 'https://openalex.org/W2898622295', 'https://openalex.org/W2903808894', 'https://openalex.org/W2904730684', 'https://openalex.org/W2921912966', 'https://openalex.org/W2931684697', 'https://openalex.org/W2941296407', 'https://openalex.org/W2979412239', 'https://openalex.org/W2980918277', 'https://openalex.org/W2980942239', 'https://openalex.org/W2984630589', 'https://openalex.org/W3001010696', 'https://openalex.org/W3004560547', 'https://openalex.org/W3016834185', 'https://openalex.org/W3016863607', 'https://openalex.org/W3016972814', 'https://openalex.org/W3025789691', 'https://openalex.org/W3030517023', 'https://openalex.org/W3048184376', 'https://openalex.org/W3140554452', 'https://openalex.org/W4206818003', 'https://openalex.org/W4239991198', 'https://openalex.org/W4241653049', 'https://openalex.org/W4253284221', 'https://openalex.org/W628877654']",Ommen,,False,

The HZO/ZO capacitors exhibited a higher remanent polarization (2Pr = Pr+ − Pr−) and breakdown voltage (Vbd) than capacitors with a HfxZr1−xO2 (HZO) single layer. In particular, a HZO (15 nm)/ZO(10 nm) (HZ15Z10) capacitor exhibited excellent Vbd and 2Pr values of 6.7 V and 14 μC/cm2, respectively, which are much higher than those (4.3 V and 10 μC/cm2, respectively) for a HZO (15 nm) (HZ15) capacitor. The HZ15Z10 capacitor also exhibited higher endurance, a smaller wake-up effect (∼5%), and superior fatigue properties up to 108 switching cycles, compared to a HZ15 capacitor, which exhibited a large wake-up effect (∼15%) and large 2Pr degradation at 108 cycles. The wake-up behavior is attributed to domain depinning mainly related to the redistribution of oxygen vacancies and transformation from the nonferroelectric phase to the ferroelectric orthorhombic (O) phase during field cycling. The HZO/ZO bilayer grew a larger grain size with the ZO nucleation layer, which is twice as large as that of the HZO single layer, and the former structure exhibited more stable bulk-like ferroelectricity. Although the ferroelectric O phase in HZO decreased with increasing HZO thickness, the HZO/ZO structure had a larger fraction of the O phase than the HZO structure.

Therefore, the PSCs are potential candidates to replace traditional crystalline silicon‐based solar cells. However, the PCE and stability of PSCs need to be improved for successful commercialization. Recently, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology is successfully applied to fabricate the encapsulation layer, which overcomes the long‐standing issues of perovskite‐based solar cells based on others’ pioneering work on ALD in PSCs several years ago. The organic–inorganic alternating encapsulation structure that the team researched has exhibited a water vapor transmittance rate of 1.3 × 10 −5 g m −2 day −1 , which is the lowest value among the reported thin‐film encapsulation layers of PSCs. Herein, the properties of ALD and how it is used in PSCs, such as device architecture, surface modification, passivation, and encapsulation, which result in higher PCEs and excellent stability, are discussed. In addition, the potential significance of applying ALD in the manufacture of tandem and flexible PSCs and the synthesis of high‐quality perovskite materials is also analyzed.",advanced photonics research,['2699-9293'],journal,11,"['https://openalex.org/W1543655293', 'https://openalex.org/W1867797769', 'https://openalex.org/W1959370848', 'https://openalex.org/W1981420304', 'https://openalex.org/W1981467837', 'https://openalex.org/W1982301519', 'https://openalex.org/W1984947161', 'https://openalex.org/W1985798309', 'https://openalex.org/W1986312350', 'https://openalex.org/W1990140174', 'https://openalex.org/W1991210869', 'https://openalex.org/W1998534931', 'https://openalex.org/W1999617030', 'https://openalex.org/W2014519034', 'https://openalex.org/W2022879044', 'https://openalex.org/W2035869425', 'https://openalex.org/W2041923506', 'https://openalex.org/W2045699336', 'https://openalex.org/W2049414944', 'https://openalex.org/W2056202384', 'https://openalex.org/W2056592516', 'https://openalex.org/W2057327293', 'https://openalex.org/W2067910821', 'https://openalex.org/W2078161010', 'https://openalex.org/W2081640113', 'https://openalex.org/W2090129700', 'https://openalex.org/W2090775216', 'https://openalex.org/W2102776508', 'https://openalex.org/W2108339468', 'https://openalex.org/W2116004146', 'https://openalex.org/W2119092271', 'https://openalex.org/W2125469086', 'https://openalex.org/W2134041621', 'https://openalex.org/W2146293086', 'https://openalex.org/W2150690597', 'https://openalex.org/W2151010124', 'https://openalex.org/W2154322410', 'https://openalex.org/W2156019254', 'https://openalex.org/W2156171228', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701', 'https://openalex.org/W2166145023', 'https://openalex.org/W2201636966', 'https://openalex.org/W2212480046', 'https://openalex.org/W2258638061', 'https://openalex.org/W2280920385', 'https://openalex.org/W2284117193', 'https://openalex.org/W2300329730', 'https://openalex.org/W2301656337', 'https://openalex.org/W2301687243', 'https://openalex.org/W2317763659', 'https://openalex.org/W2330732790', 'https://openalex.org/W2334482494', 'https://openalex.org/W2335471869', 'https://openalex.org/W2344731217', 'https://openalex.org/W2398920238', 'https://openalex.org/W2403433049', 'https://openalex.org/W2460679048', 'https://openalex.org/W2469388998', 'https://openalex.org/W2476110197', 'https://openalex.org/W2509900470', 'https://openalex.org/W2512549170', 'https://openalex.org/W2515717280', 'https://openalex.org/W2519764630', 'https://openalex.org/W2534444542', 'https://openalex.org/W2549882031', 'https://openalex.org/W2555502003', 'https://openalex.org/W2556010593', 'https://openalex.org/W2558211233', 'https://openalex.org/W2559871476', 'https://openalex.org/W2568003237', 'https://openalex.org/W2583396742', 'https://openalex.org/W2586392534', 'https://openalex.org/W2603180017', 'https://openalex.org/W2607064008', 'https://openalex.org/W2607953390', 'https://openalex.org/W2609458232', 'https://openalex.org/W2610723038', 'https://openalex.org/W2611866608', 'https://openalex.org/W2629151498', 'https://openalex.org/W2709487316', 'https://openalex.org/W2729523528', 'https://openalex.org/W2735094026', 'https://openalex.org/W2752550611', 'https://openalex.org/W2763884609', 'https://openalex.org/W2785892986', 'https://openalex.org/W2790131079', 'https://openalex.org/W2792627810', 'https://openalex.org/W2794411553', 'https://openalex.org/W2795560075', 'https://openalex.org/W2799927241', 'https://openalex.org/W2807733623', 'https://openalex.org/W2810460672', 'https://openalex.org/W2811047378', 'https://openalex.org/W2812941852', 'https://openalex.org/W2850973227', 'https://openalex.org/W2885818996', 'https://openalex.org/W2888019280', 'https://openalex.org/W2888200283', 'https://openalex.org/W2889249727', 'https://openalex.org/W2889823934', 'https://openalex.org/W2910820242', 'https://openalex.org/W2911786627', 'https://openalex.org/W2936504975', 'https://openalex.org/W2939809568', 'https://openalex.org/W2945757074', 'https://openalex.org/W2952840089', 'https://openalex.org/W2954104079', 'https://openalex.org/W2970927303', 'https://openalex.org/W2972851170', 'https://openalex.org/W2973335593', 'https://openalex.org/W2979021990', 'https://openalex.org/W2994646276', 'https://openalex.org/W3036498681']",Zhao,,False,

PIM‐1 with six ALD cycles (PIM‐1‐Al 2 O 3 ‐6) exhibited simultaneous high thermal, mechanical, pure‐ and mixed‐gas separation, and anti‐aging properties. The O 2 /N 2 , H 2 /N 2 , and H 2 /CH 4 separation performances were adequate above the latest trade‐off lines. PIM‐1‐Al 2 O 3 ‐6 showed CO 2 and O 2 permeabilities of 624 and 188 Barrer, combined with CO 2 /CH 4 and O 2 /N 2 selectivities of 56.2 and 8.8, respectively.

Kozlova, Elizaveta Rogacheva, Л. А. Краева, Maxim Maximov","Deposition, Metal coating","In recent years, antibacterial coatings have become a significant approach in the global fight against bacterial pathogens. Developments in materials science, chemistry and biochemistry have led to a plethora of materials and chemical compounds that have potential for creating antibacterial coatings. Nonetheless, there has been insufficient consideration given to the analysis of the techniques and technologies used to apply these coatings. Among the various inorganic coating techniques, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is noteworthy. It enables the successful synthesis of high-purity inorganic nanocoatings on surfaces of complex shape and topography, while also providing precise control over their thickness and composition. ALD has various industrial applications, but its practical application in medicine is still limited. In recent years, a substantial number of papers have been published on the suggested implementation of thin films and coatings produced through ALD in medicine, notably those with antibacterial properties. The aim of this paper is to carefully evaluate and analyse the relevant literature on this subject. Simple oxide coatings, including TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, MgO, and ZrO2, were examined, as well as coatings containing metal nanoparticles such as Ag, Cu, Pt, and Au, and mixed systems such as TiO2-ZnO, TiO2-ZrO2, ZnO-Al2O3, TiO2-Ag, and ZnO-Ag. Through comparative analysis, we have been able to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of various antibacterial coatings of different compositions, including key characteristics such as thickness, morphology, and crystal structure. ALD has been analysed in its use for developing antibacterial coatings for various applications. Furthermore, assumptions regarding the most promising development areas have been presented.",,,,4,"['https://openalex.org/W1612161398', 'https://openalex.org/W175137187', 'https://openalex.org/W1967416163', 'https://openalex.org/W1967749052', 'https://openalex.org/W1994463138', 'https://openalex.org/W2007592439', 'https://openalex.org/W2019896592', 'https://openalex.org/W2021646306', 'https://openalex.org/W2026651107', 'https://openalex.org/W2037055214', 'https://openalex.org/W2042849693', 'https://openalex.org/W2046465279', 'https://openalex.org/W2074630285', 'https://openalex.org/W2081198158', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701', 'https://openalex.org/W2166145243', 'https://openalex.org/W2168843978', 'https://openalex.org/W2183330967', 'https://openalex.org/W2344614365', 'https://openalex.org/W2417083294', 'https://openalex.org/W2429639999', 'https://openalex.org/W2567563697', 'https://openalex.org/W2577911204', 'https://openalex.org/W2589569437', 'https://openalex.org/W2594525179', 'https://openalex.org/W2621334591', 'https://openalex.org/W2621344740', 'https://openalex.org/W2621913440', 'https://openalex.org/W2625758836', 'https://openalex.org/W2628373425', 'https://openalex.org/W2734204398', 'https://openalex.org/W2734906162', 'https://openalex.org/W2736480483', 'https://openalex.org/W2762879257', 'https://openalex.org/W2774871376', 'https://openalex.org/W2775191300', 'https://openalex.org/W2804949406', 'https://openalex.org/W2891055371', 'https://openalex.org/W2891319196', 'https://openalex.org/W2893027745', 'https://openalex.org/W2893419411', 'https://openalex.org/W2898513708', 'https://openalex.org/W2905211567', 'https://openalex.org/W2910877519', 'https://openalex.org/W2913951811', 'https://openalex.org/W2914562856', 'https://openalex.org/W2914927764', 'https://openalex.org/W2931422570', 'https://openalex.org/W2931684697', 'https://openalex.org/W2954260513', 'https://openalex.org/W2969687186', 'https://openalex.org/W2979013343', 'https://openalex.org/W2997993755', 'https://openalex.org/W2999415728', 'https://openalex.org/W3001010696', 'https://openalex.org/W3003547753', 'https://openalex.org/W3004560547', 'https://openalex.org/W3011730974', 'https://openalex.org/W3015542162', 'https://openalex.org/W3036831146', 'https://openalex.org/W3045440433', 'https://openalex.org/W3091985208', 'https://openalex.org/W3092695473', 'https://openalex.org/W3093310506', 'https://openalex.org/W3104042368', 'https://openalex.org/W3118615836', 'https://openalex.org/W3119399472', 'https://openalex.org/W3129158131', 'https://openalex.org/W3130270495', 'https://openalex.org/W3131359428', 'https://openalex.org/W3148258874', 'https://openalex.org/W3155437137', 'https://openalex.org/W3183274700', 'https://openalex.org/W3192334993', 'https://openalex.org/W3200002525', 'https://openalex.org/W3207917202', 'https://openalex.org/W3215269391', 'https://openalex.org/W4214481748', 'https://openalex.org/W4214730975', 'https://openalex.org/W4220940525', 'https://openalex.org/W4221108163', 'https://openalex.org/W4280492806', 'https://openalex.org/W4282839821', 'https://openalex.org/W4285151193', 'https://openalex.org/W4295107370', 'https://openalex.org/W4297251101', 'https://openalex.org/W4306362101', 'https://openalex.org/W4308041356', 'https://openalex.org/W4311039781', 'https://openalex.org/W4324133564', 'https://openalex.org/W4324311493', 'https://openalex.org/W4360603652', 'https://openalex.org/W4367310427', 'https://openalex.org/W4377287614', 'https://openalex.org/W4383743286', 'https://openalex.org/W4387768699', 'https://openalex.org/W649091267']",Nazarov,,False,

The grown film was analyzed by the high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, and Raman spectrum analysis. The analyses show that the PE-ALD-grown carbon film has an amorphous structure. It was found that the existence of defective sites (nanoscale holes or cracks) on the substrate of copper foil could facilitate the formation of nanolayered carbon films.

Ruud van Ommen","Polydimethylsiloxane, Surface Modification, Absorbance, Deposition","Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been widely employed as a material for microreactors and lab-on-a-chip devices. However, in its applications, PDMS suffers from two major problems: its weak resistance against common organic solvents and its chemically non-functional surface. To overcome both issues, atmospheric pressure atomic layer deposition (AP-ALD) can be used to deposit an inorganic nanolayer (TiO x ) on PDMS that, in turn, can be further functionalized. The inorganic nano layer is previously communicated to durably increase the organic solvent resistance of PDMS. In this study, we investigate the possibility of this TiO x nano layer providing surface anchoring groups on PDMS surfaces, enabling further functionalization. We treat PDMS samples cured at three different temperatures with AP-ALD and measure the hydrophilicity of the treated samples as an indicator of the presence of surface anchoring groups. We find that all the treated PDMS samples become hydrophilic right after the AP-ALD treatment. We further find that the AP-ALD-treated PDMS samples cured at 150 °C and 200 °C maintain their hydrophilicity, while the samples cured at 70 °C become less hydrophilic over time. The presence of surface anchoring groups through TiO x nano layer deposition on PDMS is further demonstrated and utilized by depositing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the AP-ALD-treated samples. The samples exhibit visible light absorbance at 530 nm, a typical absorbance peak for AuNPs. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the use of nano layers grown by AP-ALD to solve the two major problems of PDMS simultaneously, widening its applicability, especially for use in high-end applications such as catalysis and bio-sensing.",atomic layer deposition,['2772-2570'],journal,4,"['https://openalex.org/W1967803430', 'https://openalex.org/W1970591211', 'https://openalex.org/W1971500740', 'https://openalex.org/W1991812267', 'https://openalex.org/W1992396382', 'https://openalex.org/W1995927245', 'https://openalex.org/W2001888948', 'https://openalex.org/W2015741550', 'https://openalex.org/W2022472470', 'https://openalex.org/W2028339715', 'https://openalex.org/W2031732057', 'https://openalex.org/W2032226657', 'https://openalex.org/W2034351800', 'https://openalex.org/W2046698337', 'https://openalex.org/W2053262718', 'https://openalex.org/W2057784649', 'https://openalex.org/W2088495047', 'https://openalex.org/W2150743378', 'https://openalex.org/W2154856902', 'https://openalex.org/W2218425088', 'https://openalex.org/W2469450463', 'https://openalex.org/W2527995625', 'https://openalex.org/W2608947055', 'https://openalex.org/W2620993523', 'https://openalex.org/W2621344740', 'https://openalex.org/W2682193417', 'https://openalex.org/W2806817369', 'https://openalex.org/W2806944130', 'https://openalex.org/W2917725656', 'https://openalex.org/W2936504975', 'https://openalex.org/W2946593644', 'https://openalex.org/W2953976198', 'https://openalex.org/W2962027601', 'https://openalex.org/W2969848688', 'https://openalex.org/W2971409833', 'https://openalex.org/W2984630589', 'https://openalex.org/W2990905799', 'https://openalex.org/W3000333717', 'https://openalex.org/W3008828260', 'https://openalex.org/W3014916836', 'https://openalex.org/W3022838942', 'https://openalex.org/W3092252399', 'https://openalex.org/W3102976653', 'https://openalex.org/W3121129317', 'https://openalex.org/W3126899376', 'https://openalex.org/W3155174656', 'https://openalex.org/W3178577242', 'https://openalex.org/W4200585601', 'https://openalex.org/W4291001823']",Santoso,,False,

Then, they were characterized by X-ray spectroscopies, ellipsometry, Rutherford backscattering and scanning electron microscopy. For thin films annealed by RTP in N2, phase separation takes place, promoting the formation of HfO2 and Al2.4 O3.6 crystalline phases. In contrast, the films annealed by LASER remain predominantly amorphous with crystalline facets of Al2.4O3.6. Also, non-homogeneous distribution of the chemical elements within the dielectrics gave rise to the formation of several regions which can be viewed as sub-layers, each of them with arbitrary electron density and thickness. As a result, Kratky curves pointed out to the coexistence of different features described by different gyration radius yielding GISAXS scattering profiles with polydispersive characteristics. Finally, the samples annealed by RTP were interpreted as agglomerates of spheroids with different sizes (1.1-2.2 nm) and with different crystalline phases whereas the samples annealed by LASER were interpreted as larger spheroids of crystalline Al2.4O3.6 (1.7-2.7nm) embedded in a matrix predominantly amorphous.",journal of integrated circuits and systems,"['1807-1953', '1872-0234']",journal,3,"['https://openalex.org/W1604284211', 'https://openalex.org/W1664012981', 'https://openalex.org/W1673855059', 'https://openalex.org/W1967196449', 'https://openalex.org/W1970424470', 'https://openalex.org/W1977026158', 'https://openalex.org/W1999692521', 'https://openalex.org/W2003495098', 'https://openalex.org/W2003645630', 'https://openalex.org/W2021407985', 'https://openalex.org/W2022175767', 'https://openalex.org/W2024063169', 'https://openalex.org/W2026339405', 'https://openalex.org/W2040811649', 'https://openalex.org/W2041246757', 'https://openalex.org/W2053674573', 'https://openalex.org/W2057796434', 'https://openalex.org/W2060441787', 'https://openalex.org/W2062616307', 'https://openalex.org/W2067647303', 'https://openalex.org/W2077770884', 'https://openalex.org/W2086529087', 'https://openalex.org/W2093383653', 'https://openalex.org/W2094669952', 'https://openalex.org/W2101809422', 'https://openalex.org/W2112554416', 'https://openalex.org/W2120749366', 'https://openalex.org/W2129631332', 'https://openalex.org/W2142654956', 'https://openalex.org/W2144166460', 'https://openalex.org/W2144987693', 'https://openalex.org/W2155699383', 'https://openalex.org/W2156843115', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701', 'https://openalex.org/W2168491503', 'https://openalex.org/W2170408275', 'https://openalex.org/W2319023005', 'https://openalex.org/W2326599158', 'https://openalex.org/W2504992731', 'https://openalex.org/W2590763898', 'https://openalex.org/W589995197', 'https://openalex.org/W654870860']",Huanca,,False,

Wyatt, Brady Bateman, Camden Boyle, Matthias J. Young, Matthew R. Maschmann",Surface Modification,"Abstract Area‐selective atomic layer deposition (AS‐ALD) techniques are an emerging class of bottom‐up nanofabrication techniques that selectively deposit patterned ALD films without the need for conventional top‐down lithography. To achieve this patterning, most reported AS‐ALD techniques use a chemical inhibitor layer to proactively block ALD surface reactions in selected areas. Herein, an AS‐ALD process is demonstrated that uses a focused electron beam (e‐beam) to dissociate ambient water vapor and “write” highly resolved hydroxylated patterns on the surface of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The patterned hydroxylated regions then support subsequent ALD deposition. The e‐beam functionalization technique facilitates precise pattern placement through control of beam position, dwell time, and current. Spatial resolution of the technique exceeded 42 nm, with a surface selectivity of between 69.9% and 99.7%, depending on selection of background nucleation regions. This work provides a fabrication route for AS‐ALD on graphitic substrates suitable for fabrication of graphene‐based nanoelectronics.",nano select,['2688-4011'],journal,3,"['https://openalex.org/W1463728261', 'https://openalex.org/W1968625816', 'https://openalex.org/W1977000847', 'https://openalex.org/W1978389691', 'https://openalex.org/W1981156276', 'https://openalex.org/W1985081486', 'https://openalex.org/W1995191254', 'https://openalex.org/W1998860239', 'https://openalex.org/W2001894083', 'https://openalex.org/W2013697109', 'https://openalex.org/W2019751883', 'https://openalex.org/W2023603575', 'https://openalex.org/W2025931031', 'https://openalex.org/W2028896140', 'https://openalex.org/W2034497177', 'https://openalex.org/W2035931858', 'https://openalex.org/W2044079975', 'https://openalex.org/W2060715065', 'https://openalex.org/W2077313146', 'https://openalex.org/W2082415642', 'https://openalex.org/W2087899039', 'https://openalex.org/W2093034330', 'https://openalex.org/W2094477992', 'https://openalex.org/W2106245861', 'https://openalex.org/W2119309397', 'https://openalex.org/W2124715150', 'https://openalex.org/W2137032131', 'https://openalex.org/W2139393388', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701', 'https://openalex.org/W2214965132', 'https://openalex.org/W2316995493', 'https://openalex.org/W2410184850', 'https://openalex.org/W2550850424', 'https://openalex.org/W2555184189', 'https://openalex.org/W2589816053', 'https://openalex.org/W2748656712', 'https://openalex.org/W2749856728', 'https://openalex.org/W2805065452', 'https://openalex.org/W2904730684', 'https://openalex.org/W2914888251', 'https://openalex.org/W2931684697', 'https://openalex.org/W3006157302', 'https://openalex.org/W3022796453', 'https://openalex.org/W3025789691', 'https://openalex.org/W3133646241', 'https://openalex.org/W3136973343', 'https://openalex.org/W3214056545', 'https://openalex.org/W3214236723', 'https://openalex.org/W3217274619']",Koerner,,False,

Thus, thanks to gas-solid reactions that are substrate-limited and self-terminating, precise control over thickness below the nanometer level can be achieved. While ALD was originally developed to deposit uniform coatings over large areas and on high-aspect-ratio features, in recent years the possibility to perform ALD in a selective fashion has gained much attention, in what is known as area-selective deposition (ASD). ASD is indeed a novel 3D printing approach allowing the deposition of functional materials (for example metals to oxides, nitrides or sulfides) with nanometric resolution in Z. The chapter will present an introduction to ALD, which will be followed by the description of the different approaches currently being developed for the ASD of functional materials (including initial approaches such as surface pre-patterning or activation, and newer concepts based on spatial CVD/ALD).

Likewise, electron concentration, and thus conductivity, can be tuned in a wide range reaching a low resistivity of ~10−3 Ω cm, which can be further decreased by Al doping to ~10−4 Ω cm. On the other hand, highly resistive samples obtained under oxygen-rich conditions provide a good starting point for acceptor doping. Moreover, typical advantages of the ALD method, such as conformal coverage of surfaces with highly developed morphology, possibility of low temperature growth, and thickness control in nanometer scale, make ZnO–ALD an interesting material for various applications.

By absorption of photons, electrons are excited and reach higher states to initiate a redox reaction. This principle can be broadly used to produce chemicals such as hydrogen via the reduction of water or transform carbon dioxide into solar fuels, i.e., methane, methanol, and formaldehyde. Besides chemical production, the reductive/oxidative potential of the excited electrons/holes can be utilized to degrade molecules. This is especially useful for self-cleaning materials or for cleaning waste water streams from molecules such as dyes, pesticides, or pharmaceuticals, as water pollution levels increasingly harm human health, especially in developing countries. Despite the great potential and vast research activities over the last decades, the development of cheap and efficient photocatalysts and especially the evaluation of the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation pathways are still lacking, which hampers the translation from lab to application. TiO2 (P25) is a cheap and non-toxic photoactive material, yet too inefficient for water cleaning. This thesis focuses on the surface modification of TiO2 (P25), minimizing various drawbacks of TiO2 (P25) and on the evaluation of the photocatalytic mechanisms.

The coatings were obtained by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of aluminum oxide on the structured ITO films. The transmission electron microscopy showed that the deposited nanosized aluminum oxide layer was of good quality and uniformly covered the ITO whiskers. As shown in experiments, the thickness of the resulting Al 2 O 3 layer is affected by the thickness and, hence, by the degree of surface roughness of the initial ITO film. The resulting thicknesses can be several times lower than that planned in the experiment, based both on the calculations of the parameters of the ALD process and on the direct measurements of the aluminum oxide deposition rate for unstructured ITO films. A possible reason that affects the growth rate of A1O 3 layers in nanostructured ITO films is a strong increase in the surface area of the ITO film during its structuring. So, the transmission and scanning microscopy data for a 700 nm-thick structured ITO film have shown that its surface area is more than 20 times greater than that of a smooth film.

The deposition of GaP was carried out by the method of plasma enhanced atomic-layer deposition using in situ treatment in argon plasma. It was shown that at the initial stage of the growth of GaP layers on precisely oriented (100) Si substrates and with misorientation, two-dimensional growth occurs both after chemical and plasma surface treatment. Upon growth on (111) substrates, after plasma treatment of the surface, a transition to three-dimensional growth is observed, at which the size of islands reaches 30-40 nm. The smallest root-mean-square roughness of the surface of the growing GaP layers (&lt;0.1 nm) was achieved for (100) substrates with a misorientation of 4 o . The GaP layers grown on (100) substrates had a roughness of ~0.1 nm, and on substrates with the (111) orientation --- 0.12 nm. It was found that the surface treatment of Si substrates with the (100) orientation in hydrogen plasma leads to a slight increase in the surface roughness of growing GaP layers (0.12-0.14 nm), which is associated with the effect of inhomogeneous etching of silicon in hydrogen plasma. When treating the (100) silicon surface in argon plasma, the surface roughness does not change significantly in comparison with the chemical surface treatment. On the surface of substrates with preliminary deposition of an epitaxial Si layer with a thickness of 4 nm, the morphology of GaP layers is the same as in the case of using hydrogen plasma.

Wooding, Shawn A. Gregory, Amalie Atassi, Guillaume Freychet, Kyriaki Kalaitzidou, Mark D. Losego",,"Background : We report on the fundamental crystallization kinetics of atomic layer deposited (ALD) TiO2 thin films undergoing a post-deposition anneal (PDA) at low temperatures to probe differences in the as-deposited film microstructure. Methods : The system of study is ALD TiO2 thin films prepared from tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium(IV) (TDMAT) and water at 120 °C, 140 °C and 160 °C followed by ex situ low temperature annealing at temperatures ranging from 140 °C to 220 °C. All as-deposited TiO2 thin films are amorphous by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Post-deposition annealing (PDA) produces large grain anatase crystals, confirmed by XRD and top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A detailed SEM study is performed to quantify the nucleation and growth kinetics by fitting microstructural data to the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation. Finally, a time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram is constructed to summarize the differences in crystallization behavior at different ALD deposition temperatures. Results and conclusions : Fitting microstructural data to the JMAK equation reveals an Avrami exponent close to 3 with continuous nucleation, suggesting two-dimensional, plate-like crystal growth. Applying an Arrhenius relationship to the phase transformation data, the combined activation energy for nucleation and growth is found to be 1.40–1.58 eV atom-1.

Losego",Avrami equation,"Background: We report on the fundamental crystallization kinetics of atomic layer deposited (ALD) TiO2 thin films undergoing a post-deposition anneal (PDA) at low temperatures to probe differences in the as-deposited film microstructure. Methods: The system of study is ALD TiO2 thin films prepared from tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium(IV) (TDMAT) and water at 120 °C, 140 °C and 160 °C followed by ex situ low temperature annealing at temperatures ranging from 140 °C to 220 °C. All as-deposited TiO2 thin films are amorphous by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Post-deposition annealing (PDA) produces large grain anatase crystals, confirmed by XRD and top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A detailed SEM study is performed to quantify the nucleation and growth kinetics by fitting microstructural data to the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation. Finally, a time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram is constructed to summarize the differences in crystallization behavior at different ALD deposition temperatures. Results and Conclusions: Fitting microstructural data to the JMAK equation reveals an Avrami exponent close to 3 with continuous nucleation, suggesting two-dimensional, plate-like crystal growth. Applying an Arrhenius relationship to the phase transformation data, the combined activation energy for nucleation and growth is found to be 1.40–1.58 eV atom-1. Nucleation rates are determined, and an Arrhenius relationship is used to calculate the critical Gibbs free energy for nucleation (~1.3-1.4 eV atom-1). As such, nucleation is the rate-limiting step for the amorphous to anatase phase transformation.

Opportunities exist for merging this existing technique with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to achieve molecular- or atomic-level spatial precision. Several demonstrations have been performed using graphene as the support substrate. A common challenge that arises during this process is e-beam-induced hydrocarbon deposition, suggesting greater control over the sample environment is needed. Various strategies exist for cleaning graphene in situ. One of the most effective methods is to rapidly heat to high temperatures, e.g., 600 C or higher. While this can produce large areas of what appears to be atomically clean graphene, mobile hydrocarbons can still be present on the surfaces. Here, we show that these hydrocarbons are primarily limited to surface migration and demonstrate an effective method for interrupting the flow using e-beam deposition to form corralled hydrocarbon regions. This strategy is effective for maintaining atomically clean graphene at high temperatures where hydrocarbon mobility can lead to substantial accumulation of unwanted e-beam deposition.",nano select,['2688-4011'],journal,11,"['https://openalex.org/W1879864432', 'https://openalex.org/W1966160269', 'https://openalex.org/W1968326511', 'https://openalex.org/W1980851192', 'https://openalex.org/W1981473805', 'https://openalex.org/W1992687266', 'https://openalex.org/W1996391948', 'https://openalex.org/W1999647781', 'https://openalex.org/W1999947486', 'https://openalex.org/W2010440585', 'https://openalex.org/W2016614856', 'https://openalex.org/W2017799055', 'https://openalex.org/W2029026207', 'https://openalex.org/W2030682524', 'https://openalex.org/W2031652129', 'https://openalex.org/W2043068745', 'https://openalex.org/W2051982557', 'https://openalex.org/W2052383696', 'https://openalex.org/W2053691908', 'https://openalex.org/W2058075900', 'https://openalex.org/W2065322813', 'https://openalex.org/W2065429801', 'https://openalex.org/W2073675736', 'https://openalex.org/W2090774743', 'https://openalex.org/W2099540110', 'https://openalex.org/W2128934324', 'https://openalex.org/W2137333311', 'https://openalex.org/W2145023731', 'https://openalex.org/W2153297088', 'https://openalex.org/W2158252203', 'https://openalex.org/W2267477053', 'https://openalex.org/W2324197426', 'https://openalex.org/W2333286472', 'https://openalex.org/W2413988599', 'https://openalex.org/W2525732359', 'https://openalex.org/W2559260027', 'https://openalex.org/W2585554570', 'https://openalex.org/W2594399778', 'https://openalex.org/W2601810315', 'https://openalex.org/W2745441039', 'https://openalex.org/W2755512750', 'https://openalex.org/W2767095237', 'https://openalex.org/W2776673741', 'https://openalex.org/W2793061204', 'https://openalex.org/W2801148178', 'https://openalex.org/W2948059253', 'https://openalex.org/W2996702406', 'https://openalex.org/W2999453395', 'https://openalex.org/W3037554291', 'https://openalex.org/W3099833853', 'https://openalex.org/W3101744697', 'https://openalex.org/W3102860331', 'https://openalex.org/W3103572015', 'https://openalex.org/W3105636786', 'https://openalex.org/W3120736840', 'https://openalex.org/W3122940626', 'https://openalex.org/W4247056401', 'https://openalex.org/W4300048831', 'https://openalex.org/W577118849', 'https://openalex.org/W937186902']",Dyck,,False,

This study explores and addresses the experimental approach for composite materials with one of the major concerns of high capacitance, and low leakage, as well as ease of integration technology. The characteristics of Al2O3 supported HfO2 (AHO) thin films for a series of different Hf ratios with Al2O3 dielectrics by atomic layer deposition demonstrated as a candidate material. A composite AHO films with the homogeneous compositions of Al and Hf atoms into the Al-Hf-O mixed oxide system could stabilize the polycrystalline structure with increasing of dielectric constant (k) and decreasing of leakage current density, as well as a higher breakdown voltage than HfO2 film on its own. 70 nm thick AHO thin films with different composition of Al and Hf contents were prepared by atomic layer deposition technique on titanium nitride (TiN) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) coated Si substrates. Photolithography and metal lift-off technique were used for the device fabrication of the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor structures. AHO films on TiN/SiO2/Si were measured by semiconductor analyzer and source/ measure system with probe station in the voltage range from -5 to 5 V with a frequency range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz were used to conduct capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements with low/medium frequency range and current-voltage (I-V) measurements. It was found that Au/AHO/TiN/SiO2/Si MIM capacitors demonstrate a capacitance density of 1.5 - 4.5 fF/μm2 at 10 kHz, a loss tangent of 0.02 - 0.04 at 10 kHz, dielectric constant of 11.7 - 35.5 depending on the composition and a low leakage current of 1.7 × 10-9 A/cm2 at 0.5 MV/cm at room temperature. The acquired experimental results could show the possibility of compositional alloy thin films that could potentially replace or open new market for high-k challenges in semiconductor technology.",materials sciences and applications,"['2153-117X', '2153-1188']",journal,1,"['https://openalex.org/W1512740549', 'https://openalex.org/W1632897666', 'https://openalex.org/W1669216561', 'https://openalex.org/W1968406658', 'https://openalex.org/W1974716372', 'https://openalex.org/W1978932172', 'https://openalex.org/W1994327471', 'https://openalex.org/W2002904152', 'https://openalex.org/W2003645630', 'https://openalex.org/W2023353733', 'https://openalex.org/W2041139634', 'https://openalex.org/W2042306272', 'https://openalex.org/W2054443108', 'https://openalex.org/W2061518320', 'https://openalex.org/W2068036292', 'https://openalex.org/W2074194257', 'https://openalex.org/W2081673783', 'https://openalex.org/W2114853176', 'https://openalex.org/W2124062010', 'https://openalex.org/W2128240512', 'https://openalex.org/W2130028915', 'https://openalex.org/W2136263087', 'https://openalex.org/W2166895322', 'https://openalex.org/W2262166553', 'https://openalex.org/W2285829614', 'https://openalex.org/W2891782044', 'https://openalex.org/W2957239853', 'https://openalex.org/W3017794264', 'https://openalex.org/W3108327175', 'https://openalex.org/W3124522786']",Wang,,False,

Schmitt, Vivek Beladiya, Stefan Kund, Adriana Szeghalmi","Conformal coating, Deposition, Pillar","Abstract Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a key coating technology which enables conformal coatings on high aspect ratio substrates. In addition, it allows for a precise thickness control of thin films, multilayers, and nanolaminates. It is a chemical coating technology where the precursors are introduced sequentially in the reactor or are spatially separated. Herein, basic principles of ALD are introduced, reactor geometries are overviewed, and typical ALD materials and applications are summarized. ALD thin films are one pillar of modern computer technologies where ultra‐thin, conformal coatings with exceptional physical, electrical, and chemical properties are essential. Numerous emerging applications have been demonstrated and some are already in mass‐production. Precursor and process development, tool design and engineering, extensive thin‐film optimization, the search for better materials and composites combined with expert knowledge in the application fields have led to this success.",digital encyclopedia of applied physics,,journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1461198929', 'https://openalex.org/W1547089208', 'https://openalex.org/W1574097797',

Pure layered V 2 O 5 has a high theoretical capacity (585 mAh g −1 ), but it suffers severe capacity decay. Pre‐inserting cations into V 2 O 5 can substantially stabilize the performance, but at an expense of lowered capacity. Here we show that an atomic layer deposition derived V 2 O 5 can be an excellent ZIB cathode with high capacity and exceptional cycle stability at once. We report a rapid in situ on‐site transformation of V 2 O 5 atomic layers into Zn 3 V 2 O 7 (OH) 2 ⋅2 H 2 O (ZVO) nanoflake clusters, also a known Zn‐ion and proton intercalatable material. High concentration of reactive sites, strong bonding to the conductive substrate, nanosized thickness and binder‐free composition facilitate ionic transport and promote the best utilization of the active material. We also provide new insights into the V 2 O 5 ‐dissolution mechanisms for different Zn‐salt aqueous electrolytes and their implications to the cycle stability.",angewandte chemie,"['0044-8249', '1521-3757']",journal,53,"['https://openalex.org/W1992985800', 'https://openalex.org/W2075908945', 'https://openalex.org/W2274496528', 'https://openalex.org/W2515146993', 'https://openalex.org/W2519218628', 'https://openalex.org/W2519765864', 'https://openalex.org/W2586637063', 'https://openalex.org/W2765688457', 'https://openalex.org/W2769966976', 'https://openalex.org/W2770449070', 'https://openalex.org/W2774004638', 'https://openalex.org/W2781499021', 'https://openalex.org/W2796025373', 'https://openalex.org/W2801873687', 'https://openalex.org/W2803467114', 'https://openalex.org/W2887614386', 'https://openalex.org/W2889163545', 'https://openalex.org/W2893067879', 'https://openalex.org/W2903315989', 'https://openalex.org/W2907932968', 'https://openalex.org/W2922088926', 'https://openalex.org/W2922648584', 'https://openalex.org/W2928935003', 'https://openalex.org/W2941622960', 'https://openalex.org/W2942794426', 'https://openalex.org/W2943434901', 'https://openalex.org/W2946754848', 'https://openalex.org/W2953485569', 'https://openalex.org/W2954002369', 'https://openalex.org/W2963527979', 'https://openalex.org/W2967391741', 'https://openalex.org/W2971613977', 'https://openalex.org/W2972668029', 'https://openalex.org/W2975964556', 'https://openalex.org/W2978443603', 'https://openalex.org/W2980435907', 'https://openalex.org/W2983527717', 'https://openalex.org/W2991269734', 'https://openalex.org/W2995756634', 'https://openalex.org/W2999957013', 'https://openalex.org/W3004025419', 'https://openalex.org/W3004936197', 'https://openalex.org/W3007375757', 'https://openalex.org/W3008368794', 'https://openalex.org/W3015289860', 'https://openalex.org/W3016135749', 'https://openalex.org/W3024609852', 'https://openalex.org/W4210496802', 'https://openalex.org/W4213000893']",Lu,,False,

It can lead to destructive heating of the ceramic or arcing on the window surface. This is typically addressed by sputtering a thin layer of titanium nitride on the vacuum side of the window ceramic. This works well for relatively small ceramics but leads to poor uniformity over large surfaces. High power RF windows are required at 704 MHz, which require windows approximately 23 inches in diameter. This is larger than can be reliably coated using sputtering. This research is developing technology to apply Multipactor suppression coatings using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), which provides unprecedented control of the coating thickness and uniformity. It is independent of surface area and allows coating of multiple surfaces in parallel, with associated cost reduction. In addition, ALD bonding is stronger than that provided by sputtering, leading to more robust protection. This presentation will describe the ALD system and process.

Rudenko","Redistribution, Deposition","The depth distribution of carbon impurities in hafnium oxide films obtained by plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition is studied experimentally and theoretically. An analytical model is proposed that describes the dependence of the carbon impurity concentration profile in the film. The model takes into account the fact that the formation of a carbon impurity in the growing film may be caused by the incomplete oxidation of the organometallic precursor. The diffusion redistribution of impurities is determined by mech-anisms that take into account the presence of carbon in different kinds of states: an insoluble state (carbides, carbonates), a highly mobile state (CO, CO2), and an unstable state whose lifetime is longer than the film’s growth time. The possibility of controlling the carbon impurity both in deep and near-surface layers is shown. The predictions of the model are confirmed experimentally using the mass spectrometry of the secondary ions in the films obtained by atomic layer deposition. To test the theory, special structures of hafnium oxide are developed, consisting of several layers, in which the time of the plasma exposure to the sample is varied at the same dosage of the organometallic precursor. The layer with the shortest exposure time to the plasma is deposited on the substrate, then the same number of cycles on the next layer take place, provided that the exposure time is increased by a factor of n. This makes it possible to deepen the transition zones and thus pro-tect them from the effects of the atmosphere.",микроэлектроника,['0544-1269'],journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1615623400', 'https://openalex.org/W1996917463', 'https://openalex.org/W2001607685', 'https://openalex.org/W2046709975', 'https://openalex.org/W2061738465', 'https://openalex.org/W2075523616', 'https://openalex.org/W2081102995', 'https://openalex.org/W2083672128', 'https://openalex.org/W2093141452', 'https://openalex.org/W2118921812', 'https://openalex.org/W2141584646', 'https://openalex.org/W2152593607', 'https://openalex.org/W2180310438', 'https://openalex.org/W2259020227', 'https://openalex.org/W2333145895', 'https://openalex.org/W2437425376', 'https://openalex.org/W2443941261', 'https://openalex.org/W2582311434', 'https://openalex.org/W2587248279', 'https://openalex.org/W2743958375', 'https://openalex.org/W2788658421', 'https://openalex.org/W2789774329', 'https://openalex.org/W2801830602', 'https://openalex.org/W2895772630', 'https://openalex.org/W2963500085', 'https://openalex.org/W3121490885', 'https://openalex.org/W3131364643', 'https://openalex.org/W3174277247', 'https://openalex.org/W4284669488', 'https://openalex.org/W4306836125', 'https://openalex.org/W766863904']",Фадеев,,False,

ALD is a conformal coating process, that can be used to apply ultra-thin films of metal oxides on various materials, that may have a sophisticated three-dimensional shape, such as the internal and external components of satellites. The challenge with metal oxides on soft and/or flexible surfaces arises from the brittle nature of these ceramic films if their thickness exceeds 30 nm. Different substrates, including silicon, Printed Circuitry Board (PCB), polyimide, and Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) were coated by ALD with 20 nm thick metal oxide films at 125 °C, then exposed to ATOX and characterized by photographing, reflectance measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The studies showed good performance of protective films prepared by ALD on polymer substrates, which suggests that the nanometer-scale coatings can improve the lifetime of these materials at low Earth orbit, where they are inevitably exposed to ATOX. In contrast, the uncoated substrates suffered near-surface damage after exposure to ATOX, which resulted in microscopic features on their surface that were visible in SEM. Damage caused by ATOX to the uncoated substrates was also visible in photographs and observable in reflectance studies. In the latter case, the changes in the reflectance spectrum were caused by the change of surface morphology and/or chemical and elemental composition due to corrosion by ATOX.",iop conference series materials science and engineering,"['1757-8981', '1757-899X']",conference,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1990558109', 'https://openalex.org/W2044666397', 'https://openalex.org/W2802478197', 'https://openalex.org/W3092144064', 'https://openalex.org/W3126191142', 'https://openalex.org/W4211262805', 'https://openalex.org/W4283378475', 'https://openalex.org/W884721863']",Merisalu,,False,

The unique layer-by-layer growth mechanism of ALD enables exceptional uniformity, conformality and accurate control of film thickness for a plethora of materials. In physical sciences, especially in optical systems, these properties are of utmost importance as sustaining optical performance not only requires a high degree of uniformity, but also excellent conformality when it comes to complex micro- or macrostructures. To reach a high level of uniformity and conformality on complex macro shapes, such as highly curved lenses or spherical domes, effort needs to be made to specifically twist, turn, rotate or otherwise move the structures. For the traditional physical vapor deposition, this comes with an extensive load of mechanical work and process optimization, ultimately leading to a tight control of the process parameters. In the end, the optimized processes may still not lead to a sufficiently homogeneous film deposition on the most challenging structures. In this work, we demonstrate that we have been able to overcome these constraints by utilizing our P-series ALD batch tools to deposit various optical coatings on complex 3D macrostructures. As example structures, we use a topless cube (length, height, width = 150 mm) and a hemispherical dome (diameter = 155 mm). By depositing various low-loss oxide materials (SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub> and Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and by measuring their resulting thickness distributions from various locations throughout the 3D bodies, we have been able to achieve non-uniformities ranging from less than 1 % to 2.5 % over the entire structures. In addition, we have designed and deposited anti-reflective, highly reflective and edge-pass coatings on these structures and verified that excellent spectral responses from 400 to 2500 nm can be obtained. Ultimately, our results demonstrate an exceptional method to realize high-quality optical coatings on the most challenging surfaces, paving the way for the mass production of critical optical components in macroscale for a variety of applications ranging from military to microscopy.",,,,0,[],Rönn,,False,

Wojtecki,"Deposition, Presentation (obstetrics)","Area selective deposition (ASD) strategies are broadly enabling, where their application is anticipated to impact semiconductor scaling, in the short term, and broadly impact the design of non-traditional hardware such as phase change memory for specialized artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. In order to extend scaling, ASD may be required for the formation of self-aligned structures on patterned substrates that enable schemes, such as fully aligned via. The design of inhibiting materials including small molecule, polymer brushes and area selective surface polymerizations can be tailored to enable the selective deposition of a variety of metal oxide films (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2 or ZnO). The inhibiting materials examined systematically varied inhibitor spacing, composition and surface cleans prior to inhibitor deposition. The examination of a range of materials provides insight into the fundamental mechanisms of inhibition between precursor chemistries and their interaction with surfaces. Furthermore, while the materials generally exploited for inhibition are relegated to small molecules and may require multiple cycles of etch-back processes followed by renewal of the surface inhibitor polymeric materials may offer the potential to access ASD of films with devices that have significant surface topography where they act as effective inhibitors over small molecules. This was achieved with the area selective growth of polymers where the area selective control of a polymerization on a 100nm tall copper line space feature enabled the selective deposition on a silicon dielectric. In addition, while the ASD of some film compositions could not be achieved with polymer inhibitors the ALD on polymer regions of a patterned film increased the porosity of the metal oxide changing the film's etch resistance, this could be exploited to achieve the area selective etch of metal features.",,,,0,[],Wojtecki,,False,

Results demonstrated that the effects of the deposited films depended on both the cathode and ALD film composition. On cathodes prepared by infiltration of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF) and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM), rates for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) are significantly enhanced by addition of submonolayers of A-site cations and reduced by addition of B-site cations. Surface termination is less important for La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 (LSCo). Multilayers of all oxides were found to dramatically decrease electrode performance. Attempts to enhance O2 dissociation by addition of catalytic metals (Pd, Ni, and Co) demonstrated that only Co on LSF significantly enhanced performance, probably by increasing the surface vacancy concentration; but Co, Ni, and Pd had no effect on LSCo or LSCF. Finally, in all cases, elevated temperatures caused migration of the thin-film cations into the bulk and restoration of the initial performance. Attempts were also made to form thicker (>2 nm), dense films of ZrO2 and CeO2 on La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) electrodes to prevent SrO migration, followed by addition of catalysts onto the thicker ALD films.

In this contribution, we compare the growth of epsilon-near-zero GZO and AZO films on sapphire by two different deposition techniques: molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). For MBE of GZO, a multiple buffer consisted of a high-temperature MgO layer, a low-temperature ZnO, followed by a high-temperature ZnO layer is employed to assure the crystalline quality of the GZO film. By controlling the growth parameters, including Ga doping level, VI/II ratio, substrate temperature, we are able to produce GZO films at 350 °C with electron mobility between 30 and 50 cm2/V.s, electron concentration up to 7×1020 cm-3, and resistivity down to 2.5×10-4 Ω.cm. For ALD of AZO, without using any buffer, by reducing the Al pulse duration, we are able to grow the AZO films under a large ratio of Al to Zn pulses of 1:6, which improves the activation of Al as an effective dopant. Hence AZO films with electron concentration above 7×1020 cm-3, electron mobility between 10 and 20 cm2/V.s, and resistivity below 6×10-4 Ω.cm have been obtained at 250 °C. The corresponding epsilon-near-zero point in the ALD-grown material was tuned down to 1470 nm. Our data indicate that the ALD method provides a low-temperature route to plasmonic TCOs for telecommunication wavelength range. Effect of electron mobility on optical loss and, therefore, plasmonic figure of merit is discussed.",,,,0,[],Fomra,,False,

Mengesha, Mohammad Reza Shaeri","Purge, Deposition","For a better understanding the effects of size and number of outlet manifolds of a viscous flow reactor on the purge duration in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, three-dimensional multicomponent gas transports inside the reactors with different outlet configurations are investigated through reactor scale simulations.The simulations are performed at a fixed operating pressure and temperature of 10 torr (1333 Pa) and 300 °C, respectively.Several reactor designs are considered and results are compared with a reactor that is used as the base of comparison.Because of low values of Knudsen numbers (less than 0.01) inside the reactors, applying the continuum flow assumption with no-slip boundary conditions is accurate to simulate the multicomponent flow.The Navier-Stokes and species transport equations are discretized through the finite volume method to simulate transient, laminar, and multicomponent flows.It is found that the purge durations are mainly dictated by the outlet velocity such that as long as the average outlet velocity remains the same, the purge times are almost similar among all reactors with different number of outlets.Also, results suggest that there is a threshold purge velocity such that beyond this value the purge times become independent from the outlet velocity.","proceedings of the international conference on fluid flow and thermal science, icffts ...",['2563-5301'],conference,0,"['https://openalex.org/W2023603575', 'https://openalex.org/W2087781684', 'https://openalex.org/W2089007545', 'https://openalex.org/W2201726470', 'https://openalex.org/W2342041549', 'https://openalex.org/W2803116546', 'https://openalex.org/W2891055371', 'https://openalex.org/W2936318418', 'https://openalex.org/W2941296407', 'https://openalex.org/W3137235938']",Mengesha,,False,

The atomic composition of the ZnO layer was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and its crystallinity was characterized using X-ray diffraction. The predominance of the content of O atoms by 5-10%, compared with the content of Zn atoms, was found. The electronic characteristics of the ZnO/phenolphthalein structure were studied using total current spectroscopy (TCS) in the energy range from 5 eV to 20 eV above E F during thermal vacuum deposition of phenolphthalein films up to 8 nm thick. Phenolphthalein molecules contain two hydroxyl functional groups. The TCS results on the phenolphthalein films are compared with the TCS results obtained from films of molecules that represent the backbone of phenolphthalein molecules without hydroxyl groups. The TCS fine structure maxima of phenolphthalein films located in the energy range from 5 eV to 8 eV above E F can be associated with the boundaries of the π * bands of electronic states. The work function of the ZnO surface formed by the ALD method were 4.2±0.1 eV. The deposition of a phenolphthalein film led to a decrease in the work function of the surface by 0.1 eV.

Vohs, Raymond J. Gorte, Steve McIntosh","Cermet, Deposition","The overall objective of this project was to use atomic layer deposition (ALD) to add modifiers to the surfaces of conventional Ni-YSZ cermet, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes to enhance both their tolerance to hydrocarbon fuels by decreasing their propensity to form coke deposits, and to increase redox stability. Studies of the use of ALD to modify analogous supported metal powder catalysts were also added to the scope of the project in response to our industrial partner, Atrex going out of business. The initial portion of the program focused on designing and building the ALD reactor required for deposition of the oxide modifier films. Studies of the oxide modifier films on the coking tolerance and of redox properties of Ni-cermet anodes were then carried out. These studies demonstrated that while surface oxide modifiers were able to impart some coking resistance this only occurred for a relatively small range of operating conditions (e.g., temperature, steam-to-fuel ratio, etc.) and not at the level that would be required for operating in methane fuel at low steam-to-methane ratios. In light of this observation, we focused on assessing another approach to enhance anode coking resistance which eliminated bulk Ni from the anode. This approach made use of electronically conducting perovskite films to provide electrical conductivity in the anode, while using small amounts of Ni or other metals, such as Pt, deposited using ALD as the anode oxidation catalyst. This approach proved to be quite promising at both imparting coking resistance and redox stability.",,,,0,[],Vohs,,False,

Further, the device showed different conduction mechanism in LRS and HRS modes.

Parsons,Deposition,"Deposition-based patterning is becoming an important need in advanced manufacturing. Several new approaches are emerging where chemical etching is being coupled with atomic layer deposition to achieve area-selective deposition of dielectrics and metals. During ALD, selectivity is generally lost when undesired nuclei form on the targeted non-growth surface. These undesired nuclei can sometimes be removed by periodic etching, improving the overall selectivity. However, it is not known to what extent these coupled deposition/etching sequences can proceed while maintaining good selectivity. As desirable deposition and etching reactions proceed, other changes in the process can occur to enhance unwanted nucleation and/or impede desired etching, thereby limiting the net selectivity. Recent experiments in our lab have used in-situ probes to explore coupled thermal ALD and ALE super-cycles, performed sequentially under isothermal conditions in a single reaction chamber, to achieve area selective deposition of TiO2 on SiO2 with hydrogen-terminated silicon (100) as the desired non-growth surface. We find that as ALD/ALE super-cycles proceed, small changes occur in the ALD and ALE reactions, particularly during the transition from ALD to ALE, or from ALE to ALD. Likewise, a new thermally-driven ALE process for tungsten has been applied in ALD/ALE super-cycles to improve W ASD. In this case, the ALE process alters the ALD surface leading to significant changes in the ALD. Modeling studies allow us to quantitatively analyze the ASD results and compare our findings to other known approaches. These insights will be helpful to understand opportunities and challenges in advanced deposition-based patterning.",,,,0,[],Parsons,,False,

Ruud van Ommen","Selective catalytic reduction, Deposition","Based on the 2019 report of the European Environment Agency on Air Quality in Europe nitrogen oxides (NOx) were identified as the most harmful air pollutants in terms of damage to ecosystems. Moreover, in Europe, NO2 is pinpointed as one of the most dangerous pollutants for human health. Anthropogenic emissions of NOx are mainly generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. Nitrogen oxides being emitted into the atmosphere cause environmental problems such as acid rain, acidification of soil, lakes and rivers, eutrophication and photochemical smog. The most effective and widely applicable technology to date for the purification of flue gases from NOx is selective catalytic reduction using ammonia (NH3-SCR de-NOx). Nowadays, one of the most significant research fields in NH3-SCR de-NOx is the application of unconventional reduction methods and the preparation of novel catalysts possessing high specific surface area, uniformity, dispersion of active sites, activity and selectivity. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an attractive technique for the deposition of uniformly distributed active catalytic layers, or nanoparticles, on highly porous substrates characterized by a complex structure. For this type of materials, conventional catalyst preparation methods (e.g., impregnation or deposition precipitation) can encounter several limitations. The significant advantage of ALD for the preparation of supported catalysts is that the process can be controlled on the atomic scale, providing the required thickness of an active layer, synthesized with a sub-nm accuracy. Moreover, ALD ensures the formation of catalytic sites from the gas phase, which enhances the possibility of active species being deposited inside pores which are very small in size. In this study, ALD was applied to the preparation of VxOy-based NH3-SCR de-NOx catalysts. Highly porous silica gel powder (63–100 μm) with a specific surface area of up to 450 m2·g−1 was used as a substrate for VxOy/SiO2 with different metal loadings (wt.%). In addition (VxOy+TiO2)/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by applying vanadium (V) tri-i-propoxy oxide (VTIP) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as precursors with deionized water as the co-reactant. Elemental analysis (ICP-OES) revealed that vanadium loadings of the VxOy/SiO2 catalysts were 0.3, 0.7, 1.1 and 1.60 wt.%, while the loadings in the TiO2-promoted VxOy/SiO2 catalyst were 1.0 and 0.2 wt.% for V and Ti, respectively. The obtained XPS spectra indicated the presence of V2O3 and V2O5 species (V2O5/V2O3 ratio was 1.6 and 6.3 for the as-synthesized and calcined samples respectively). Vanadium(V) oxide is known to be a catalytically active compound for NH3-SCR de-NOx. Additionally, TEM, XRD and N2 adsorption (BET) analyses were conducted to provide a comprehensive characterization of the species size, crystalline phase and porosity of the catalysts prepared.",,,,0,[],Urbanas,,False,

Our research shows that a single-layer of aluminum oxide (AlOx) deposited through thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water (H2O) at low temperatures (~60°C) serves as an acceptable protection coating without adversely impacting the optical performance of the mirrors. While the use of TMA and H2O as precursors in thermal ALD offers AlOx that performs decently in the field, it degrades quickly in environmental tests under high-humidity at high-temperature conditions, suggesting that there is room to improve. In this paper, two approaches by which ALD processes of AlOx protection coatings can be improved are investigated: exploring another precursor for oxygen and implementing a pre-deposition conditioning. The study is carried out by introducing two new processes – the use of Pure Ozone (PO) and Ozone-Ethylene Radical (OER) in comparison to thermal ALD with TMA and H2O. Our study shows that samples prepared by PO have the initial spectral reflectance lower than that of those prepared by the thermal ALD; however, reflectance of the PO samples remains nearly constant 1.6 times longer in the environmental test, suggesting promising characteristics of AlOx prepared with PO.",,,,0,[],Tornøe,,False,

Davis, Geoffrey Gregory",Passivation,"In this project, the University of Central Florida (UCF) worked to both increase module efficiency and reduce manufacturing cost by driving demonstrated lab-scale passivating contact technology using materials and processes compatible with high-volume manufacturing for crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) cells. Passivating contacts have garnered significant attention in recent years. They provide a means of suppressing contact recombination, a loss mechanism that limits the performance of industrially relevant cell architectures like Al back surface field (Al-BSF) cells and passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC). Most of the development of passivating contact technology has focused on the use of doped amorphous silicon or doped polysilicon contacts, but both suffer from parasitic optical absorption amongst other issues. Our team developed fully transparent hole-selective heterojunctions, deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD), and showed how they could be incorporated into c-Si PV cells. The team conducted experiments to understand the process-structure-property relationship of hole-selective oxides, surface passivation oxide materials, and transparent conductive oxides deposited by ALD, and use that understanding to reduce contact recombination, contact resistivity, and parasitic optical absorption within c-Si PV cells. Before getting into the details of the report, we would like to note that COVID-19 has made it more challenging to conduct experimental research at UCF. UCF has a number of mandatory policies in place to ensure social distancing, testing, and contact tracing are all carried out in day-to-day operations. Despite these challenges, we worked diligently to make progress on this project in a manner that was as safe as possible.

However, the inherent black color of CNTFs hinders their practical application in fields with high aesthetic requirements such as wearable devices and smart textiles. Due to the smooth surface and chemical inertness, CNTFs are hard to be dyed by conventional chemical dyes or colorful inks. Herein, we realize a structural coloration of CNTFs by coating them with two metal oxide layers via atomic layer deposition. The three elements of color, that is, hue, saturation, and brightness, can be controlled by adjusting the types and thickness of each oxide layer. Colorful CNTFs with wide color gamut and high saturation are achieved through different combinations. A film interference model is also established to reveal the mechanism of the structural coloration, which is a comprehensive result of thin‐film interference and surface roughness briefly. The calculated reflectance well fits the measured results by introducing surface roughness parameters. Moreover, the colored CNTFs are not iridescent because of retinal signal delay, which will further expand their applications.",susmat,"['2692-4552', '2766-8479']",journal,20,"['https://openalex.org/W1964546718', 'https://openalex.org/W1975589842', 'https://openalex.org/W1992448897', 'https://openalex.org/W2007206536', 'https://openalex.org/W2007737299', 'https://openalex.org/W2021767229', 'https://openalex.org/W2035931858', 'https://openalex.org/W2036581304', 'https://openalex.org/W2043620862', 'https://openalex.org/W2052100813', 'https://openalex.org/W2053370222', 'https://openalex.org/W2063219977', 'https://openalex.org/W2088407462', 'https://openalex.org/W2152127048', 'https://openalex.org/W2168264864', 'https://openalex.org/W2218219623', 'https://openalex.org/W2482136714', 'https://openalex.org/W2595605641', 'https://openalex.org/W2620236107', 'https://openalex.org/W2800868414', 'https://openalex.org/W2805810423', 'https://openalex.org/W2883335409', 'https://openalex.org/W2900151921', 'https://openalex.org/W2943889223', 'https://openalex.org/W2952059447', 'https://openalex.org/W2955874659', 'https://openalex.org/W3081309036', 'https://openalex.org/W3107789702', 'https://openalex.org/W3112309698', 'https://openalex.org/W3114175353', 'https://openalex.org/W3121912712', 'https://openalex.org/W4205740296', 'https://openalex.org/W4283733752', 'https://openalex.org/W4293004743']",Li,,False,

From this review, synthesis parameters that will affect the ZnO-Ag nanoparticle and its application will be concluded. The gas-phase synthesis methods include flame spray pyrolysis, spray pyrolysis, sputtering, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, electron beam evaporation, atomic layer deposition and electrospinning. It is clearly observed that the morphology, crystallinity, and performance of ZnO-Ag nanocomposite is significantly affected by the fabrication method. The precursors used, spray rate, deposition rate, precursor concentration, deposition time, morphology of the nanoparticle and deposition or annealing temperature affect the performance capability of ZnO-Ag.

The photoelectrochemical properties, such as photoactivity and selectivity of WO 3 in different electrolytes, are already well understood. However, the understanding of stability, one of the most important properties for utilization in a commercial device, is still in the early stages. In this work, a photoelectrochemical scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer is applied to determine the influence of co‐catalyst overlayers on photoanode stability. Spray‐coated WO 3 photoanodes are used as a model system. Iridium is applied to the electrodes by atomic layer deposition in controlled layer thickness, as determined by ellipsometry and x‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Photoactivity of the iridium‐modified WO 3 photoanodes decreases with increasing iridium layer thickness. Partial blocking of the WO 3 surface by iridium is proposed as the main cause of the decreased photoelectrochemical performance. On the other hand, the stability of WO 3 is notably increased even in the presence of the thinnest investigated iridium overlayer. Based on our findings, we provide a set of strategies to synthesize nanocomposite photoelectrodes simultaneously possessing high photoelectrochemical activity and photostability.",susmat,"['2692-4552', '2766-8479']",journal,11,"['https://openalex.org/W1498028909', 'https://openalex.org/W1623117034', 'https://openalex.org/W1966134601', 'https://openalex.org/W1967749052', 'https://openalex.org/W1970013017', 'https://openalex.org/W1976309082', 'https://openalex.org/W1981727971', 'https://openalex.org/W1985673622', 'https://openalex.org/W1991077818', 'https://openalex.org/W2003095845', 'https://openalex.org/W2020007931', 'https://openalex.org/W2038591363', 'https://openalex.org/W2045473418', 'https://openalex.org/W2045779126', 'https://openalex.org/W2059069721', 'https://openalex.org/W2063171302', 'https://openalex.org/W2064006286', 'https://openalex.org/W2072858607', 'https://openalex.org/W2076699898', 'https://openalex.org/W2087208885', 'https://openalex.org/W2092263931', 'https://openalex.org/W2116382224', 'https://openalex.org/W2148968943', 'https://openalex.org/W2155305805', 'https://openalex.org/W2170214641', 'https://openalex.org/W2170269315', 'https://openalex.org/W2321309470', 'https://openalex.org/W2332854342', 'https://openalex.org/W2507767197', 'https://openalex.org/W2554000342', 'https://openalex.org/W2574987849', 'https://openalex.org/W2593425684', 'https://openalex.org/W2613797882', 'https://openalex.org/W2623208246', 'https://openalex.org/W2730954043', 'https://openalex.org/W2783670792', 'https://openalex.org/W2793307964', 'https://openalex.org/W2794268861', 'https://openalex.org/W2794979932', 'https://openalex.org/W2807304377', 'https://openalex.org/W2809684303', 'https://openalex.org/W2884265769', 'https://openalex.org/W2891991193', 'https://openalex.org/W2897812888', 'https://openalex.org/W2908598735', 'https://openalex.org/W2918378560', 'https://openalex.org/W2921275266', 'https://openalex.org/W2941803205', 'https://openalex.org/W2943683623', 'https://openalex.org/W2954530441', 'https://openalex.org/W2971860472', 'https://openalex.org/W3001356488', 'https://openalex.org/W3007054730', 'https://openalex.org/W3091834798', 'https://openalex.org/W3120760247', 'https://openalex.org/W3161290677', 'https://openalex.org/W3195170247', 'https://openalex.org/W4205821415', 'https://openalex.org/W4241456496']",Jenewein,,False,

However, as effective as AlOx coatings are in high temperature/high humidity (HTHH) testing, the mirrors tend to catastrophically fail after an extended period of time during the HTHH test. In order to further improve long-term resilience, the use of Pure Ozone (PO) as an oxygen precursor in replacing H2O is proposed and investigated. While the initial reflectance of the samples prepared with PO is slightly lower than those prepared with H2O, they exhibit better resilience during the HTHH test. In this paper, the study on progressive structural changes that occur in silver-based telescope mirrors protected by AlOx is described over several different stages during cyclic HTHH tests (i.e., temperature is cycled between two, high and low, temperatures). Two types of samples are prepared using either H2O or PO as an oxidation precursor and compared. The study reveals that the initial drop in spectral reflectance of the PO samples during the first HTHH cycle is associated with the surface reconfiguring itself in the presence of the extra energy which effectively tempers the surface to gain higher stability.",,,,0,[],Tornøe,,False,

The WSe 2 nanoflakes had well‐defined thicknesses as measured by atomic force microscopy, and the Pt nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited by a variable number of atomic layer deposition (ALD) cycles. An exceptionally high photocurrent density of 49.6 mA cm −2 (under 220 mW cm −2 irradiation) and internal‐photon‐to‐electron‐conversion efficiency (∼90% at 550 nm) were demonstrated on these Pt‐decorated WSe 2 (WSe 2 ‐Pt) photocathodes. The Pt NP loading and thickness of WSe 2 nanoflakes (in the 24–235 nm range) were used to fine‐tune their PEC activity for HER. We found similar charge transfer and surface recombination kinetics of pristine and WSe 2 ‐Pt specimens (as assessed by intensity‐modulated photocurrent spectroscopy), which indicated significant differences in their bulk properties. X‐ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies were performed to identify defect states and quantify the density of states around the valence band of WSe 2 . The elevated temperature of the ALD process and the evolving Pt NP phase conspired to passivate the sub‐surface (i.e., bulk) defects in the WSe 2 nanoflakes, resulting in their vastly improved PEC performance.",susmat,"['2692-4552', '2766-8479']",journal,9,"['https://openalex.org/W1526026297', 'https://openalex.org/W1606781888', 'https://openalex.org/W1873545257', 'https://openalex.org/W1971377560', 'https://openalex.org/W1971416289', 'https://openalex.org/W1981130398', 'https://openalex.org/W1982799704', 'https://openalex.org/W1993711106', 'https://openalex.org/W1994690009', 'https://openalex.org/W2009125029', 'https://openalex.org/W2011929520', 'https://openalex.org/W2018970165', 'https://openalex.org/W2028955839', 'https://openalex.org/W2037707774', 'https://openalex.org/W2043391767', 'https://openalex.org/W2048480083', 'https://openalex.org/W2079591655', 'https://openalex.org/W2086816140', 'https://openalex.org/W2151747661', 'https://openalex.org/W2162192659', 'https://openalex.org/W2214476518', 'https://openalex.org/W2279727602', 'https://openalex.org/W2316325289', 'https://openalex.org/W2329685788', 'https://openalex.org/W2333848840', 'https://openalex.org/W2586058225', 'https://openalex.org/W2593229437', 'https://openalex.org/W2607674714', 'https://openalex.org/W2618590689', 'https://openalex.org/W2729154857', 'https://openalex.org/W2737949718', 'https://openalex.org/W2747008139', 'https://openalex.org/W2760400979', 'https://openalex.org/W2767842917', 'https://openalex.org/W2768396169', 'https://openalex.org/W2772275969', 'https://openalex.org/W2889722664', 'https://openalex.org/W2951783224', 'https://openalex.org/W2995710197', 'https://openalex.org/W3004488104', 'https://openalex.org/W3011967972', 'https://openalex.org/W3023309484', 'https://openalex.org/W3035805465', 'https://openalex.org/W3036940585', 'https://openalex.org/W3118673538', 'https://openalex.org/W3123414933', 'https://openalex.org/W3152109791', 'https://openalex.org/W3163483194', 'https://openalex.org/W3192259781', 'https://openalex.org/W4282015095']",Tóth,,False,

Here a series of inverse model catalysts of ZnO on copper hydroxide were prepared where the size of ZnO was precisely tuned from atomically dispersed species to nanoparticles using atomic layer deposition. ZnO decoration boosted methanol formation to a rate of 877 g MeOH kg cat −1 h −1 with ≈80 % selectivity at 493 K. High pressure in situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the atomically dispersed ZnO species are prone to aggregate at oxygen‐deficient ZnO ensembles instead of forming CuZn metal alloys. By modeling various potential active structures, density functional theory calculations and microkinetic simulations revealed that ZnO/Cu interfaces with oxygen vacancies, rather than stoichiometric interfaces, Cu and CuZn alloys were essential to catalytic activation.",angewandte chemie,"['0044-8249', '1521-3757']",journal,7,"['https://openalex.org/W1596532924', 'https://openalex.org/W1862595321', 'https://openalex.org/W1870760280', 'https://openalex.org/W1974147116', 'https://openalex.org/W1991692033', 'https://openalex.org/W1996768019', 'https://openalex.org/W2005897483', 'https://openalex.org/W2008359230', 'https://openalex.org/W2011377242', 'https://openalex.org/W2031992940', 'https://openalex.org/W2039786475', 'https://openalex.org/W2045748009', 'https://openalex.org/W2048609013', 'https://openalex.org/W2051796629', 'https://openalex.org/W2055542007', 'https://openalex.org/W2059804578', 'https://openalex.org/W2060710374', 'https://openalex.org/W2063198976', 'https://openalex.org/W2070297733', 'https://openalex.org/W2073552412', 'https://openalex.org/W2076222325', 'https://openalex.org/W2082843087', 'https://openalex.org/W2107491558', 'https://openalex.org/W2113826077', 'https://openalex.org/W2141312310', 'https://openalex.org/W2149576395', 'https://openalex.org/W2149941988', 'https://openalex.org/W2152193384', 'https://openalex.org/W2153971907', 'https://openalex.org/W2158685795', 'https://openalex.org/W2167493614', 'https://openalex.org/W2214269855', 'https://openalex.org/W2295376186', 'https://openalex.org/W2324048221', 'https://openalex.org/W2325029536', 'https://openalex.org/W2326995674', 'https://openalex.org/W2396232752', 'https://openalex.org/W2511433364', 'https://openalex.org/W2517924650', 'https://openalex.org/W2528194497', 'https://openalex.org/W2552131409', 'https://openalex.org/W2579891120', 'https://openalex.org/W2600566292', 'https://openalex.org/W2725648806', 'https://openalex.org/W2747629573', 'https://openalex.org/W2762487790', 'https://openalex.org/W2765326595', 'https://openalex.org/W2765469889', 'https://openalex.org/W2792497350', 'https://openalex.org/W2883597021', 'https://openalex.org/W2890275795', 'https://openalex.org/W2891319196', 'https://openalex.org/W2909849873', 'https://openalex.org/W2911524313', 'https://openalex.org/W2981197596', 'https://openalex.org/W2991119255', 'https://openalex.org/W3005711490', 'https://openalex.org/W3006891031', 'https://openalex.org/W3024049792', 'https://openalex.org/W3024294558', 'https://openalex.org/W3043694203', 'https://openalex.org/W3047436469', 'https://openalex.org/W3100941205', 'https://openalex.org/W3109376708', 'https://openalex.org/W3135804961', 'https://openalex.org/W3176481321', 'https://openalex.org/W3183865375', 'https://openalex.org/W4206334122', 'https://openalex.org/W4210499700', 'https://openalex.org/W4210516546', 'https://openalex.org/W4237084241', 'https://openalex.org/W4240394083', 'https://openalex.org/W4240932991', 'https://openalex.org/W4249370462', 'https://openalex.org/W4251361615', 'https://openalex.org/W4251439201', 'https://openalex.org/W4254169610']",Liu,,False,

For a long time, the major academic research of III-V metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) studies was mainly oriented on searching for the suitable high-k dielectric, and among the reported high-k/III-V MOS studies, Al2O3 and AlN have demonstrated the most promising results. However, usually, the dielectrics with higher dielectric constant suffered from more defective interface quality including the HfO2, which should be overcome to meet the intensive operation voltage scaling requirements. In order to protect the interface of the HfO2/III-V MOS, the exposed III-V surface has to be carefully treated before, while, and after the whole high-k deposition process. For this purpose, the effect of isopropyl alcohol precursor and in situ cyclic nitrogen plasma treatment on the HfO2 ALD process at III-V substrates was thoroughly investigated. Remarkable interface state density levels with strong inversion behavior were achieved, which have not been observed at the previous HfO2/InGaAs studies.

This afforded significantly higher NMR signal enhancement in parahydrogen‐induced polarization experiments compared with the electron‐rich platinum on CeO 2 (100), and a factor of two higher pairwise selectivity (6.1 %) in the hydrogenation of propene than any previously reported monometallic heterogeneous Pt catalyst.",angewandte chemie,"['0044-8249', '1521-3757']",journal,5,"['https://openalex.org/W1853374276', 'https://openalex.org/W1984079364', 'https://openalex.org/W1991411804', 'https://openalex.org/W2004000075', 'https://openalex.org/W2004878979', 'https://openalex.org/W2007490608', 'https://openalex.org/W2012072515', 'https://openalex.org/W2038045235', 'https://openalex.org/W2056824171', 'https://openalex.org/W2067731236', 'https://openalex.org/W2079580838', 'https://openalex.org/W2083205829', 'https://openalex.org/W2087570091', 'https://openalex.org/W2090398913', 'https://openalex.org/W2096344676', 'https://openalex.org/W2104052148', 'https://openalex.org/W2104644286', 'https://openalex.org/W2110535401', 'https://openalex.org/W2155525358', 'https://openalex.org/W2167094359', 'https://openalex.org/W2237227792', 'https://openalex.org/W2324248953', 'https://openalex.org/W2328653033', 'https://openalex.org/W2409322059', 'https://openalex.org/W2416697891', 'https://openalex.org/W2417391440', 'https://openalex.org/W2474398724', 'https://openalex.org/W2592515084', 'https://openalex.org/W2754741824', 'https://openalex.org/W2773935583', 'https://openalex.org/W2793497834', 'https://openalex.org/W2803427589', 'https://openalex.org/W2886845821', 'https://openalex.org/W2922160912', 'https://openalex.org/W2969219815', 'https://openalex.org/W2971645267', 'https://openalex.org/W2990004039', 'https://openalex.org/W2994953888', 'https://openalex.org/W3084966447', 'https://openalex.org/W4230228975', 'https://openalex.org/W4238940711']",Song,,False,

Here, we used the facet‐selective atomic layer deposition (FS‐ALD) technique to selectively cover the (111) surface of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al 2 O 3 to increase the exposed facet ratio of (100)/(111), resulting in a faradaic efficiency ratio of C 2 H 4 /CH 4 for overcoated Cu NCs 22 times higher than that for pure Cu NCs. Peak performance of the overcoated catalyst (Cu NCs/Al 2 O 3 ‐10C) reaches a C 2 H 4 faradaic efficiency of 60.4 % at a current density of 300 mA cm −2 in 5 M KOH electrolyte, when using a gas diffusion electrode flow cell.

The morphology and surface characteristics of drug particles affect both their bulk behaviour, e.g., flowability, dispersibility and tabletability, in the manufacturing process of dosage forms as well as their bioavailability upon administration into the human body. For instance, in pulmonary drug delivery, particles with an aerodynamic diameter l5 µm are required to reach the action sites of the lungs. Surface modification provides the means to tailor crucial functionalities of pharmaceutical particles, such as dissolution, wettability, flowability and dispersibility, based on the desired formulation design. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) are gas-phase film technologies that enable atomic-level control over surface properties through the fabrication of nanoscale films on individual particles, which impact the powder performance. The benefits of ALD and MLD for pharmaceuticals compared to existing surface modification techniques include (i) gas-phase and fully solventless nature of the process, (ii) wide range of process conditions, including low temperature and atmospheric pressure, (iii) control over the amount of deposited material and film thickness in the sub-nanometer and low-nanometer range, (iv) high drug loadings due to the nanoscale films, (v) uniform and conformal films, crucial for tailored functional properties. Moreover, the possibility to carry out ALD and MLD in fluidized bed reactors offers scalable processing and manufacturing of bulk quantities of nano-engineered powders, relevant for pharmaceutical applications.

Young, Devika Choudhury, Steven Letourneau, Anil U. Mane, Angel Yanguas‐Gil, Jeffrey W. Elam","Quartz Crystal Microbalance, Dry etching, Layer by layer","Advances in semiconductor device manufacturing are limited by our ability to precisely add and remove thin layers of material in multistep fabrication processes. Recent reports on atomic layer etching (ALE) have provided the means for the precise removal of inorganic thin films deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), opening new avenues for nanoscale device design. Here, we report on a new technique for the precise removal of metal–organic thin films deposited by molecular layer deposition (MLD), which we term molecular layer etching. This etching process employs sequential exposures of lithium organic salt (LOS) and trimethylaluminum (TMA) precursors to produce self-limiting etching behavior. We employ quartz crystal microbalance experiments to demonstrate (i) etching of alucone films preloaded with LOS upon TMA exposures and (ii) layer-by-layer etching of alucone films using alternating exposures of LOS and TMA. We also identify the selectivity of these etching mechanisms. We probe the mechanism for the layer-by-layer etching of alucone using a quartz crystal microbalance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and identify that the etching proceeds via heterolytic cleaving of Al–O bonds in alucone upon LOS exposure followed by methylation to produce volatile species upon TMA exposure. The etching process results in the removal of 0.4 nm/cycle of alucone at 160 °C and up to 3.6 nm/cycle of alucone at 266 °C in ex situ etching experiments on silicon wafers. This halogen-free etching process enables etching of MLD films and provides new fabrication pathways for the control of material geometries at the nanoscale.",chemistry of materials,"['0897-4756', '1520-5002']",journal,5,"['https://openalex.org/W1967271445', 'https://openalex.org/W1970298040', 'https://openalex.org/W1978389691', 'https://openalex.org/W1979029730', 'https://openalex.org/W1983373532', 'https://openalex.org/W1983756373', 'https://openalex.org/W1994392457', 'https://openalex.org/W2008193211', 'https://openalex.org/W2008365303', 'https://openalex.org/W2010716222', 'https://openalex.org/W2015878742', 'https://openalex.org/W2029628087', 'https://openalex.org/W2032372151', 'https://openalex.org/W2034162020', 'https://openalex.org/W2049414944', 'https://openalex.org/W2052125280', 'https://openalex.org/W2056979054', 'https://openalex.org/W2059342964', 'https://openalex.org/W2078244500', 'https://openalex.org/W2088178118', 'https://openalex.org/W2088953107', 'https://openalex.org/W2094037477', 'https://openalex.org/W2103588738', 'https://openalex.org/W2106998413', 'https://openalex.org/W2111156460', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701', 'https://openalex.org/W2171778099', 'https://openalex.org/W2301687243', 'https://openalex.org/W2314947323', 'https://openalex.org/W2317194498', 'https://openalex.org/W2317260539', 'https://openalex.org/W2324933330', 'https://openalex.org/W2330136148', 'https://openalex.org/W2331752657', 'https://openalex.org/W2334021613', 'https://openalex.org/W2396514757', 'https://openalex.org/W2515223274', 'https://openalex.org/W2528766955', 'https://openalex.org/W2569654522', 'https://openalex.org/W2594473513', 'https://openalex.org/W2729627840', 'https://openalex.org/W2751659282', 'https://openalex.org/W2756461855', 'https://openalex.org/W2900407354', 'https://openalex.org/W2954713281', 'https://openalex.org/W4210389905', 'https://openalex.org/W4236673187', 'https://openalex.org/W4237969940']",Young,,False,

As such, this study explored the potential of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for the deposition of a substrate-nanolaminate interface layer for the design of a refractory oxygen barrier coating applied to individual carbon microfibers within a woven fabric. To this end, amorphous aluminum hydroxide was deposited at 350 K in a flow-type thermal ALD reactor operating at a pressure of 1.8 Torr, yielding a growth per cycle (GPC) of 1.0 Å/cycle. The conformal aspect of the amorphous films was found to be well preserved below a thickness of 45 ± 5 nm, above which reorganization of the substrate surface by junction of the previously deposited layers resulted in a uniform deposition. Furthermore, a minimal thickness of 20 ± 2 nm was required to obtain self-standing films following the thermal oxidation of the carbon microfibers. Indeed, thermal treatment at 1380 K of the coated woven fabric induced multiple occurrences of neat cracks in the aluminum oxide films, attributed to the increased rigidity and mismatch between the respective thermal expansion coefficients. The dense network of nanograins of aluminum oxide was further characterized by using 4D-STEM, revealing multiple phases and orientations.",acs applied engineering materials,['2771-9545'],journal,3,"['https://openalex.org/W1517229563', 'https://openalex.org/W1645764499', 'https://openalex.org/W1823521176', 'https://openalex.org/W1964899390', 'https://openalex.org/W1970619671', 'https://openalex.org/W1971545473', 'https://openalex.org/W1972880801', 'https://openalex.org/W1977658543', 'https://openalex.org/W1988954998', 'https://openalex.org/W1999723760', 'https://openalex.org/W2002477006', 'https://openalex.org/W2005422680', 'https://openalex.org/W2006899770', 'https://openalex.org/W2010300694', 'https://openalex.org/W2012445711', 'https://openalex.org/W2013901062', 'https://openalex.org/W2015820015', 'https://openalex.org/W2016058673', 'https://openalex.org/W2021181016', 'https://openalex.org/W2026715291', 'https://openalex.org/W2026910451', 'https://openalex.org/W2028658109', 'https://openalex.org/W2033351141', 'https://openalex.org/W2047888471', 'https://openalex.org/W2048791147', 'https://openalex.org/W2060830312', 'https://openalex.org/W2062972201', 'https://openalex.org/W2067410183', 'https://openalex.org/W2071197282', 'https://openalex.org/W2073051382', 'https://openalex.org/W2082204136', 'https://openalex.org/W2087775272', 'https://openalex.org/W2091922512', 'https://openalex.org/W2093069638', 'https://openalex.org/W2097194015', 'https://openalex.org/W2102823566', 'https://openalex.org/W2134455146', 'https://openalex.org/W2152418891', 'https://openalex.org/W2169190654', 'https://openalex.org/W2218219623', 'https://openalex.org/W2235679284', 'https://openalex.org/W2330076804', 'https://openalex.org/W2518201184', 'https://openalex.org/W2589417385', 'https://openalex.org/W2610809596', 'https://openalex.org/W2613307574', 'https://openalex.org/W2616065760', 'https://openalex.org/W2736191170', 'https://openalex.org/W2736848997', 'https://openalex.org/W2747627157', 'https://openalex.org/W2776193285', 'https://openalex.org/W2782218073', 'https://openalex.org/W2783841573', 'https://openalex.org/W2800577444', 'https://openalex.org/W2892561852', 'https://openalex.org/W2895632341', 'https://openalex.org/W2904176929', 'https://openalex.org/W2909667791', 'https://openalex.org/W2946591934', 'https://openalex.org/W2952606028', 'https://openalex.org/W3024137050', 'https://openalex.org/W3047563094', 'https://openalex.org/W3086544303', 'https://openalex.org/W3110973002', 'https://openalex.org/W3192338823', 'https://openalex.org/W3197254841', 'https://openalex.org/W4210409365', 'https://openalex.org/W4296126294', 'https://openalex.org/W4318475119', 'https://openalex.org/W4366596023']",Ligneris,,False,

In this paper, 50 nm thick Al2O3 thin films have been prepared by atomic layer deposition technique on indium tin oxide (ITO) pre-coated glass substrates and titanium nitride (TiN) coated Si substrates with typical MIM capacitor structure. Photolithography and metal lift-off technique were used for processing of the MIM capacitors. Semiconductor Analyzer with probe station was used to perform capacitance-voltage (C-V) characterization with low-medium frequency range. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of MIM capacitors were measured on precision source/measurement system. The performance of Al2O3 films of MIM capacitors on glass was examined in the voltage range from −5 to 5 V with a frequency range from 10 kHz to 5 MHz.

The first half of the chapter describes physical deposition processes in which functional coatings are deposited on component surfaces using mechanical, electromechanical, or thermodynamic techniques. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques include sputtering, e-beam evaporation, arc-PVD, and ion plating and are best suited for elements and compounds with moderate melting points or when a high-purity film is required. The remainder of the chapter covers chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes, including atomic layer deposition, plasma-enhanced and plasma-assisted CVD, and various forms of vapor-phase epitaxy, which are commonly used for compound films or when deposit purity is less critical.

A study of polycrystalline layers of zinc oxide coated with aluminum oxide using ultraviolet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is presented. Based on the results of photoelectron spectroscopy, two main factors for changing the electrical conductivity are proposed, which consist in the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas at the ZnO/Al2O3 interface and doping of the near-surface region of zinc oxide with aluminum atoms.",физика твердого тела,"['0367-3294', '1726-7498']",journal,1,[],Рябко,,False,

Ortiz‐Ortiz, Andrew J. Gayle, Jing Wang, Hannah R. Faustyn, Daniel Penley, Caleb Sherwood, Anish Tuteja, Neil P. Dasgupta","Nanomanufacturing, Deposition, Microreactor, Nanomaterials, Hydrothermal Synthesis","While many nanomaterial synthesis processes have been demonstrated at the laboratory scale, grand challenges remain at the nanomanufacturing frontier, where it is necessary to maintain tunable material structure and properties at large length scales using high-throughput, low-cost, and sustainable processes. Seeded hydrothermal synthesis is widely used to generate tunable nanostructures with controlled geometric parameters. In this study, we used atomic layer deposition to deposit precise and conformal seed layers which were subsequently processed using a customized hydrothermal flow reactor. The reactor design allows for control of the solution temperature profile in space and time, as well as the solution flow profile. Recirculation of the hydrothermal growth solution enables reduction of the chemical waste by 77–92% compared to a single pass flow reactor. This ""surface-directed assembly"" process allows for the growth of vertically aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) directly onto macroscopic (cm-scale) non-planar surfaces. We quantify the uniformity of the NW morphology using scanning electron microscopy and UV absorption measurements. The NWs were further functionalized to form superhydrophobic and optically transparent surface coatings along a curved glass dome substrate. The surface coatings were shown to significantly reduce the rate of biofouling from marine algae by ∼75%. This demonstrates a pathway for the scale-up of hydrothermal synthesis processes with a variety of applications in the biological and environmental fields, including medical devices and optical and oceanographic sensors.",acs applied engineering materials,['2771-9545'],journal,4,"['https://openalex.org/W1461198929', 'https://openalex.org/W1783489169', 'https://openalex.org/W1967369641', 'https://openalex.org/W1968185740', 'https://openalex.org/W1970961037', 'https://openalex.org/W1984962131', 'https://openalex.org/W1991019163', 'https://openalex.org/W1998534931', 'https://openalex.org/W2004668025', 'https://openalex.org/W2025117053', 'https://openalex.org/W2070902743', 'https://openalex.org/W2077266128', 'https://openalex.org/W2092034885', 'https://openalex.org/W2097845215', 'https://openalex.org/W2106788832', 'https://openalex.org/W2116645764', 'https://openalex.org/W2154707832', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701', 'https://openalex.org/W2162179246', 'https://openalex.org/W2166870085', 'https://openalex.org/W2279048069', 'https://openalex.org/W2286984955', 'https://openalex.org/W2519756044', 'https://openalex.org/W2523072680', 'https://openalex.org/W2523247752', 'https://openalex.org/W2550687280', 'https://openalex.org/W2558425297', 'https://openalex.org/W2594050955', 'https://openalex.org/W2623598930', 'https://openalex.org/W2757944980', 'https://openalex.org/W2766118576', 'https://openalex.org/W2767916391', 'https://openalex.org/W2793162923', 'https://openalex.org/W2884191942', 'https://openalex.org/W2941296407', 'https://openalex.org/W2943540409', 'https://openalex.org/W2966741821', 'https://openalex.org/W3044857776', 'https://openalex.org/W3095670403', 'https://openalex.org/W3185650518', 'https://openalex.org/W3207056621', 'https://openalex.org/W4229449549', 'https://openalex.org/W4253856484']",Ortiz‐Ortiz,,False,

This systematic review, based on an extensive analysis of 112 peer-reviewed studies encompassing over 3,500 citations, examines the integration of electrides into piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), hybrid energy harvesting systems, photovoltaic applications, thermoelectric devices, and commercial energy storage solutions. The findings indicate that electride-enhanced nanogenerators exhibit 2.5 to 3 times higher energy conversion efficiency compared to conventional materials, with hybrid PENG-TENG systems demonstrating a 30% increase in voltage output and a 25% reduction in charge dissipation. In photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications, electride-based electron transport layers (ETLs) improve solar power conversion efficiency by 15–20%, while electride-doped thermoelectric materials enhance thermal-to-electric conversion by 20–35%, making them viable candidates for waste heat recovery and renewable energy integration. Despite these advantages,the review identifies key challenges in scalability, material degradation due to oxygen and moisture exposure, and the need for cost-effective fabrication techniques. Recent advances in thin-film deposition methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), along with surface passivation techniques, have shown potential in addressing these limitations, paving the way for commercial adoption of electride-based energy devices. Additionally, over 60% of reviewed studies highlight the successful implementation of electrides in self powered IoT systems, wearable electronics, and hybrid energy storage solutions, demonstrating their real-world applicability in smart infrastructure, biomedical implants, and wireless sensor networks.",,,,3,[],Tonoy,,False,

The deposition of GaP was carried out by the method of plasma enhanced atomic-layer deposition using in situ treatment in argon plasma. It was shown that at the initial stage of the growth of GaP layers on precisely oriented (100) Si substrates and with misorientation, two-dimensional growth occurs both after chemical and plasma surface treatment. Upon growth on (111) substrates, after plasma treatment of the surface, a transition to three-dimensional growth is observed, at which the size of islands reaches 30–40 nm. The smallest root-mean-square roughness of the surface of the growing GaP layers (&lt;0.1 nm) was achieved for (100) substrates with a misorientation of 4 °.

When treating the (100) silicon surface in argon plasma, the surface roughness does not change significantly in comparison with the chemical surface treatment.

These intermediate states can be used in the processes of associative learning of a neural network based on memristor synapses and simultaneous processing of input pulses, which consists in their weighing and summation in the neuroprocessor. By the method of simultaneous magnetron sputtering of two cathodes in a reactive oxygen environment, thin films of mixed oxides with a different mole ratio of titanium and aluminum were obtained. A method for obtaining a mixed oxide with a specified metal fractions by controlling the sputtering rates of cathodes using acoustic piezoelectric sensors is described. It is shown that the introduction of Al into titanium oxide improves the electrophysical characteristics of the memristor. The existence of an optimal fraction of Al dopant maximizing the memristor resistance ratio of the high-resistive and low-resistive states is established. The results indicate that the method of reactive magnetron deposition of mixed metal oxide by simultaneous sputtering of two cathodes provides a more uniform distribution of elements across the thickness of the active layer compared with the atomic layer deposition method. The uniform distribution is necessary to improve the stability of the memristor.

The possibility to tailor the film properties through the variation of the microstructure via the deposition parameters adopted in a specific deposition technique has permitted their entrance from the simplest like protective coatings against wear and corrosion to the most technological advanced applications such as microelectronics and biomedicine, recently. In spite of such impressive progress, the connection among all steps of the thin film production, namely deposition parameters-morphology and properties, is not fully accurate. Among other reasons, the lack of characterization techniques suitable for probing films with thickness less than a single atomic layer, along with a lack of understanding of the physics have impeded the elaboration of sophisticated models for a precise prediction of film properties.

Requirements for 5G mobile communication are high-performance SAW substrates with a large SAW velocity, a small temperature coefficient of frequency, and a large electromechanical coupling factor. Reduction of the residual stress of the amorphous intermediate layer is expected to improve the bonding strength and SAW characteristics of the bonded substrate. In this report, a method of low-residual-stress amorphous film deposition for LT/quartz or LN/quartz bonding was studied. The residual stresses of amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3 films deposited by ion beam sputtering, electron cyclotron resonance sputtering, and atomic layer deposition (ALD) were evaluated. The LT substrate with an amorphous Al2O3 film deposited by ALD (ALD-Al2O3) had the minimum warpage of 0.152 µm and residual stress of 127.3 MPa. The ALD-Al2O3 film formed with near-identical thicknesses on both sides of the LT substrate simultaneously, which is likely the source of the low residual stress of the ALD-Al2O3 film.

Additionally, CMOS integration allows for integrated sensor circuits, enabling scalable and cost-effective applications. In this work, we demonstrate the deposition of pyroelectric thin films on area-enhanced structured substrates via thermal atomic layer deposition. Scanning electron microscopy indicates a conformal deposition of the pyroelectric film in the holes with a diameter of 500 nm and a depth of 8 μm. By using TiN electrodes and photolithography, capacitor structures are formed, which are contacted via the electrically conductive substrate. Ferroelectric hysteresis measurements indicate a sizable remanent polarization of up to 331 μC cm−2, which corresponds to an area increase of up to 15 by the nanostructured substrate. For pyroelectric analysis, a sinusoidal temperature oscillation is applied to the sample. Simultaneously, the pyroelectric current is monitored. By assessing the phase of the measured current profile, the pyroelectric origin of the signal is confirmed. The devices show sizable pyroelectric coefficients of −475 μC m−2 K−1, which is larger than that of lead zirconate titanate (PZT).

The sensitivity of these detectors is affected by thermal noise in the mirrors with its main source being the mechanical loss of the high index layers. These thermally driven fluctuations are a fundamental limit to optical interferometry experiments and there is a pressing need to understand the underlying processes that lead to mechanical dissipation in materials at room temperature. Two strategies are known to lower the mechanical loss: employing a mixture of Ta$_2$O$_5$ with $\approx$ 20\% of TiO$_2$ and post-deposition annealing, but the reasons behind this are not completely understood. In this work, we present a systematic study of the structural and optical properties of ion beam sputtered TiO$_2$-doped Ta$_2$O$_5$ films as a function of the annealing temperature. We show for the first time that low mechanical loss is associated with a material morphology that consists of nanometer sized Ar-rich bubbles embedded into an atomically homogeneous mixed titanium-tantalum oxide. When the Ti cation ratio is high, however, phase separation occurs in the film which leads to increased mechanical loss. These results indicate that for designing low mechanical loss mixed oxide coatings for interferometry applications it would be beneficial to identify materials with the ability to form ternary compounds while the dopant ratio needs to be kept low to avoid phase separation.",optical materials express,['2159-3930'],journal,33,"['https://openalex.org/W1973147793', 'https://openalex.org/W1977016553', 'https://openalex.org/W1977053657', 'https://openalex.org/W1987679586', 'https://openalex.org/W1994870116', 'https://openalex.org/W1996153736', 'https://openalex.org/W1997269293', 'https://openalex.org/W1997411797', 'https://openalex.org/W1998320846', 'https://openalex.org/W2007108777', 'https://openalex.org/W2010613677', 'https://openalex.org/W2012249145', 'https://openalex.org/W2016303737', 'https://openalex.org/W2018764695', 'https://openalex.org/W2023022340', 'https://openalex.org/W2025458672', 'https://openalex.org/W2038421650', 'https://openalex.org/W2040875144', 'https://openalex.org/W2050310998', 'https://openalex.org/W2051587044', 'https://openalex.org/W2064085036', 'https://openalex.org/W2068238781', 'https://openalex.org/W2079124425', 'https://openalex.org/W2079598615', 'https://openalex.org/W2087644519', 'https://openalex.org/W2104550287', 'https://openalex.org/W2108953022', 'https://openalex.org/W2123955659', 'https://openalex.org/W2133076232', 'https://openalex.org/W2138422951', 'https://openalex.org/W2138761286', 'https://openalex.org/W2148997983', 'https://openalex.org/W2151552813', 'https://openalex.org/W2263465265', 'https://openalex.org/W2323804516', 'https://openalex.org/W2346501507', 'https://openalex.org/W2523251459', 'https://openalex.org/W2559915530', 'https://openalex.org/W2582447532', 'https://openalex.org/W2733916015', 'https://openalex.org/W2792470306', 'https://openalex.org/W2964346472', 'https://openalex.org/W2971687662', 'https://openalex.org/W2986413343', 'https://openalex.org/W2990030859', 'https://openalex.org/W2996082496', 'https://openalex.org/W3008136596', 'https://openalex.org/W3010337385', 'https://openalex.org/W3024193964', 'https://openalex.org/W3082224458', 'https://openalex.org/W3098486040', 'https://openalex.org/W3103910501', 'https://openalex.org/W3106331539', 'https://openalex.org/W4234856688']",Fazio,,False,

To calculate the reflectance, distinct functions were developed in MatLab to represent the equations for transmission matrices and propagation matrices. To evaluate the approach, four pairs of HfO2-SiO2 thin film layers were simulated, with their refractive indices derived from Sellmeier’s equations, which appeared to be very successful. Although the simulation successfully predicted reflectance for the HfO2-SiO2 layers, the calculations with the Transfer Matrix Method had deviations compared to the laboratory results obtained for the more complex AlOx-Cu samples. To better understand the deviations, polynomial functions were used to model these differences which yield a pattern. suggesting that factors like unaccounted plasmonics and layer imperfections may be at play.

We performed a series of plasma depositions, material characterizations and dry-etching to investigate the effect of the deposition process condition on the surface characteristics of an ACL film to be used as a dry etch hard mask in an HAR etch process. We found that a lower chamber pressure at a higher temperature for the plasma deposition process yielded higher film hardness, and this infers that higher plasma ion energy in lower pressure regions helps to remove hydrogen atoms from the surface by increased ion bombardment. It was postulated that a higher substrate temperature gears the bake-out of hydrogen or hydroxide contaminants.

The transmission electron microscopy showed that the deposited nanosized aluminum oxide layer was of good quality and uniformly covered the ITO whiskers. As shown in experiments, the thickness of the resulting Al2O3 layer is affected by the thickness and, hence, by the degree of surface roughness of the initial ITO film. The resulting thicknesses can be several times lower than that planned in the experiment, based both on the calculations of the parameters of the ALD process and on the direct measurements of the aluminum oxide deposition rate for unstructured ITO films. A possible reason that affects the growth rate of Al2O3 layers in nanostructured ITO films is a strong increase in the surface area of the ITO film during its structuring.

Atomically thin oxide semiconductors including transition, pre-transition and post transition metal oxides are important class of two dimensional (2D) materials which offer variety of distinctive physio-chemical properties. The remarkable surface properties of 2D oxide semiconductors originate from their oxygen ions of their structure. The highly polarizable O2- ions cause large nonlinear and non-uniform distribution of charges within their structure leading to electrostatic screening in the range of 0-100 nm. It generates exceptional local surface and interfacial properties resulting in emerging specific energy states near and on the surface of ultra-thin 2D oxides. The unconventional semiconducting properties of 2D oxides originate from the different hybridization states of orbitals on the surface of 2D oxides. Since cations in 2D metal oxides adopt different oxidation states and various binding configurations, a large number of 2D metal oxide structures can be characterized. Subsequently, various electronic properties ranging from metallic to insulating behavior for the same 2D metal oxides at different stoichimetries can be observed. Due to the above mentioned privileges, a wide range of applications have been introduced and many other promising developments are expecting to be realized in future.
Ultra-thin films and nanostructured 2D oxide films are integral part of several advanced technologies. Some of their applications are well stablished in electronic devices like field effect transistors, however there are other applications which are recently introduced or are still under progress (like the engineering applications of 2D surface oxide of liquid alloys, Plasmonic devices, and 2D oxide heterostructures). Other systems exploit the privilege of ultra-thin nature of 2D oxide films to explore several new phenomena or to improve device performances. There are only restricted technologies which empower engineers to successfully achieve the wafer-scale deposition of 2D oxide films. Thus, one motivation of present book is to bring together the practical examples of wafer-scale deposition of 2D oxide semiconductors. Atomic layer deposition and chemical vapor deposition are the main vapor phase growth techniques which are discussed in present book. 
Apart from the synthesis techniques, there are several device fabrication requirements which considerably affect the performance of 2D oxide based devices. Heterostructures and heterointerfaces are the integral components of electronic devices. As a reality, the properties of 2D films are defined based on their interaction with their substrates or other heterointerfaces. Thus, one of the main topics of this book is the addressing of characteristics of 2D oxide semiconductor based heterostructures and heterointerfaces.
Today, new technologies require transparent semiconductor films for a wide range of electronic and optoelectronic applications. The 2D surface oxide of liquid alloys is one of the most natural 2D structure in nature. The idea of employment of these natural 2D oxides in electronic devices can open up a new window into the world of transparent devices. However, there are still several obstacles, such as the challenge of extraction and tailoring 2D surface oxides of liquid alloys into practical devices. The other challenge is attributed to the high bandgap of these family of 2D oxides restricting their visible light absorption. In the present book, a chapter is allocated to the engineering applications of this family of 2D oxide films. Several technical aspects are discussed giving firsthand information about device fabrication to readers. The last two chapters of present book address serval electronic applications of 2D oxide semiconductors. The optoelectronic devices, as one of the first practical application of 2D oxide films, have been addressed in an individual chapter. There are still several novel trends in 2D oxide semiconductors which are introduced in the last chapter of present book.
This book principally addresses applied researchers, scientists and production engineers who are focusing on the design of new functional optoelectronic and electronic 2D semiconductor based devices. As a valuable training source, students of materials engineering, electrical engineering, physics and chemistry can dig out fundamental knowledge about the basic performance of 2D oxide semiconductor based devices. A large number of literatures and references are cited in book, which will be of interest for those readdress who are demanding more information on various aspects of 2D oxide semiconductors, and electronic science.",crc press ebooks,,ebook platform,8,[],Akbari,,False,

Forrest,"Deposition, Solid-State Lighting","Organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) are promising solid state light sources due to their high efficiency, high color quality and flexible form factors. The key to enable low cost OLED lighting, is to rapidly fabricate thin film organic layers on a continuous flexible roll, called R2R processing. This project aims to investigate the feasibility of mass production of OLED lighting using the R2R process, from deposition to encapsulation. A high efficiency white OLED is fabricated on 10 cm-wide substrate rolls in a pilot R2R tool comprising of two different organic deposition: vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE) and organic vapor phase deposition (OVPD). A high quality encapsulation process to package OLEDs is demonstrated using an atomic layer deposition tool integrated to the R2R system without air exposure. The method to achieve ultrahigh deposition rates required by R2R processing is demonstrated by OVPD. Uniform organic semiconductor thin films grown by OVPD at rates as high as 50 Å/s are achieved. A comprehensive numerical model that is capable of simulating complex, multilayer WOLED structures is developed to provide an alternative to experimental iterations of OLED design and tests. A cost estimate on the R2R production of WOLEDs for lighting is developed. Assuming a WOLED luminance of 10 klm/m2, the cost of a WOLED light engine is anticipated to be $\$ 12.5$ /klm. With incremental reduction in material and driver costs and improved luminance, the cost of WOLED lighting can be reduced to $\$ 6.3$ /klm in the near term.

The efficiency and effectiveness of these technologies largely relies on the physicochemical properties of the functional materials used, specifically electrocatalysts. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a powerful technique for the synthesis of thin film materials, offering a unique platform for understanding electrochemical reaction mechanisms and searching for low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts. In this mini-review, we present the latest studies in which thin film materials (mainly focused on perovskite oxide thin films) via PLD have been actively utilized in the field of electrocatalysis. The fundamentals and advantages of PLD in the synthesis of thin films are discussed first. Then, emerging types of thin films associated with electrochemical applications are presented. Special emphasis is placed on material design methods to reveal the reaction mechanisms and establish the structure–performance relationships by understanding structural variations in precatalysts and surface reconstruction under reaction conditions. Finally, we discuss remaining challenges and future perspectives. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction Renewable energy storage and conversion technologies call for highly active electrocatalysts for multiple electrochemical reactions.1–6 For example, electrochemical water splitting has been demonstrated as one of the most promising technologies for the efficient production of green hydrogen.7–10 However, the overall device efficiency is hindered by the low reaction kinetics of two half-reactions, especially the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode.11–16 Thus, considerable research efforts have focused on developing high-performance oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Exploring the reactivity descriptors is a highly efficient way to predict the structure–performance relationships of a designed electrocatalyst, bypassing the traditional trial-and-error approach.17–21 Remarkably, the d-band center, the Fermi softness, the eg occupancy, the position of the O 2p band center, the transition-metal oxygen-bond covalency, and the density of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers have all been widely used for both designing and evaluating catalytic materials toward oxygen activation.18,22,23 Notably, the electrochemical reactions typically involve the surface region of the catalysts. For example, it was reported that a reaction depth of ∼14 nm was applied for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ and SrCoO3-δ during the alkaline OER process.24 However, the above-mentioned reactivity descriptors are mainly based on the bulk electronic structure of powder materials. Thus, the gap between the bulk and surface properties of the catalysts, including the composition, electronic structure, and geometric structure, hinders the accurate unraveling of structure–performance relationships.25–27 Although great efforts have been devoted to developing strategies for the synthesis of nanomaterials, it remains a major challenge to realize precise control of the composition, particle size, surface termination, crystallinity, defect density, and electrochemical performance of the obtained nanomaterials, especially by conventional chemical synthesis routes. To elucidate the nature of active sites, a well-defined model surfaces without the influence of polymer binders, carbon additives, or uncertainty in the estimations of the electrochemical surface areas of powder materials are needed.28–31 Such model surfaces can be single crystals or thin films epitaxially grown [e.g., by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or pulsed laser deposition (PLD)].32–34 In particular, as the use of well-defined thin films can explicitly regulate some key material properties that influence the electrocatalytic activity of the material, such as the crystal orientation, strain, and stoichiometry, model thin-film samples can be ideal model systems to establish and understand the structure–activity relationships.30,31,35–40 PLD is a type of physical vapor deposition technique that is used to fabricate thin films.41–44 However, studies on well-defined PLD thin films compared to powder ink-based films are rare in the field of renewables and catalysts. A timely and systematic review of electrocatalysis based on thin films synthesized by PLD is also highly desired. This focused review aims to summarize the recent advances in thin films based on the PLD technique for promoting electrocatalysis. Herein, we begin with a brief introduction of the fundamentals and advantages of PLD for the synthesis of thin film materials. The recent developments of thin films toward their applications in electrocatalysis are summarized. In addition, we emphasize design strategies, aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of reaction mechanisms and the designs of advanced electrocatalysts. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives regarding future research directions are also provided. Fundamentals and Advantages of PLD in the Synthesis of Thin Film Materials PLD, a type of physical vapor deposition technique, has some obvious advantages with regard to the synthesis of thin film nanomaterials, including ferroelectrics, ferrites, amorphous diamonds, and other ultrahard phases, biocompatible and tribological coatings, polymers, compound semiconductors, and nanocrystalline materials.38,45,46 The advantages of applying PLD to study various forms of thin films include the ease in creating artificial structures and metastable phases and the systematic control over their properties. Working Mechanism The working mechanism of PLD lies in the pulsed laser ablation process. The underlying ablation process is complex but the concept of PLD is simple. The focused beam on the polycrystalline target induces rapid heating and vaporization of the target, forming a dense plasma consisting of neutral atoms, molecules, ions, and energetic electrons. In the low-pressure oxygen atmosphere, oxide molecules are also formed. After propagation toward the heated substrate, which typically is only a few centimeters away, thin films with various morphologies are deposited (Figure 1).42 Figure 1 | Schematic of a PLD setup used for fabrication of thin film materials, including the PLD chamber and laser path. Download figure Download PowerPoint Advantages of Thin Film Fabrication by PLD To date, different techniques, including PLD, atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), MBE, sputtering, and thermal/e-beam evaporation, have been developed to fabricate thin films (Table 1).38,47–52 Compared to other thin film growth methods, PLD has various advantages. First, the rapid heating and highly nonthermal erosion caused by the high-energy laser enable the stoichiometric transfer of the multiple components by PLD. Furthermore, because there is no need for the use of electron beams or hot filaments, ambient gases can be used. With manipulation of the gas atmosphere, combined with the congruent-transfer capability, PLD can deposit high-quality thin films of multicomponent materials at a rapid deposition rate.

Here, we focus on the deposition of perovskite oxide thin films as electrocatalysts. Other simple metal oxides such as undoped CeO2 or doped CeO2 with dense/flat or porous columnar morphologies; nanoparticles of ZnO, ZnO2, SnO2, and Bi2O3, and nanocrystalline or epitaxial stabilized Bi2O3 have been reported.68–72 Even the deposition of sulfide, selenide, or carbide thin films is possible through the PLD technique.73–75 Selection of Substrates Single crystals The choice of substrate is another important factor determining the properties of the thin film. Depending on the lattice constants of the target material and the substrate, thin films can be deposited onto either single-crystalline or polycrystalline types. Figure 2 introduces various types of single-crystalline oxide substrates and the representative thin films onto which they can be epitaxially grown. With the rational selection of the substrate and precise control of the deposition conditions, including the temperature, pressure, and deposition rate, either epitaxial or polycrystalline film growth is achievable. With an appropriate selection of the single-crystal substrate to achieve epitaxial growth of the thin film, a very well-defined surface with nanometer-scale roughness can be prepared. Because the epitaxially-grown thin film with small thicknesses are in tensile or compressive strain following the lattice parameter of the substrate, the effect of strain on the surface properties of high-temperature electrocatalysts was also studied with PLD.31,32 With this strain engineering strategy, given by epitaxial growth on single-crystal substrates, the rational design of a high-performance electrocatalyst is expected. Figure 2 | Pseudocubic lattice parameters of perovskite and perovskite-related films and substrates. Download figure Download PowerPoint Conductive frameworks Besides single-crystal substrates, conductive frameworks can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of nanoscale thin film materials.76–81 The commonly used conductive frameworks for electrocatalyst design include metal substrates (e.g., metal foils, metal meshes, and metal foams) and carbon-based substrates (e.g., carbon cloth, carbon nanofiber, carbon fiber paper, carbon nanotubes, and graphene).82–84 In particular, metal foams such as Ni foam, NiFe foam, Fe foam, and Cu foam with a three-dimensional structure endow the characteristics of high conductivity, porosity, and mechanical strength, which enable high catalyst loading and efficient mass/charge transfer ability during the reaction process (Figure 3a).85 The abundant surface active sites and strong interaction between the thin film and conductive frameworks may jointly contribute to superior catalytic activity. In this regard, Du et al.77 fabricated perovskite oxide SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3-δ (SCFP) thin films deposited on Ni foam (NF; Figure 3b). Bulk SrCo0.95P0.05O3-δ has been demonstrated as a good OER electrocatalyst due to its high electrical conductivity and large amount of surface oxidative oxygen O22−/O−.86 More importantly, abundant oxygen vacancies can be created on the surface of perovskite nano-films by the PLD method (Figure 3c). Calculation results have also proved the positive role of surface oxygen vacancies in promoting the OER kinetics, as demonstrated by the remarkably decreased overpotentials (0.72 and 0.34 V for SCFP and SCFP with oxygen vacancies, respectively) (Figure 3d). SCFP-NF exhibits greatly enhanced OER activity and good stability (Figure 3e,f). In another work reported by Wang et al.,87 it was found that amorphous MoS2 films deposited on Au-coated carbon cloth (MoS2/Au/CC) by the PLD technique conducted at room temperature can serve as an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst in an acidic environment. Of note, the introduction of Au facilitated the electron transfer between the conductive substrate and MoS2. Remarkably, MoS2/Au/CC exhibited robust HER performance after 5000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV). However, the reported electrocatalysts involved in conductive substrates based on the PLD technique are still limited. More related works are expected to enrich the electrocatalysis family.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Key factors that influence the electrocatalytic performance The final composition, surface morphology, and crystal structure of deposited thin films are influenced by various adjustable parameters, such as the laser fluence, background gas pressure, gas environment, deposition temperature, substrate type, target composition, and substrate-to-target distance.28,40,88–92 Thus, adjusting these parameters allows for rational designs of advanced electrocatalysts. For instance, Boucly et al.90 investigated the influences of different deposition temperatures (from 350 to 650 °C) on the morphology, crystalline structure, and surface composition of La0.2Sr0.8CoO3-δ thin films. It was found that a high temperature facilitated Sr segregation in the topmost layers, which can be easily removed after immersion in ultrapure water, leading to a cobalt-rich surface. When the temperature ranged from 450 to 550 °C, the OER activities were positively correlated with the temperature because Sr segregation was promoted by the temperature within this range, suggesting that the amount of the surface active element also increased with the temperature. In addition, Zeng et al.68 also depicted that substrate temperature, laser fluence, and oxygen ambient pressure largely affect the optical and electrical properties for highly c-axis oriented ZnO films, while Ramana et al.42 observed the grain size change of pulsed-laser-deposited V2O5 thin films with the deposition temperature. In general, high temperature conditions result in the deposition of highly crystalline films with low defect density and large grain sizes. Oxygen ambient pressure is also a frequently controlled laser fluence and substrate-to-target distance can affect the deposition rate, which will also be a factor in determining the film morphology, where a rule of thumb is that a slower deposition rate will result in lower roughness. Thus, it is necessary to present detailed information to ensure reproducibility by different groups. In addition to summarizing the catalytic activity and main findings of advanced thin film electrocatalysts, related growth conditions are also presented. Applications of Thin Films by PLD in Electrocatalysis OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media Electrochemical water splitting has been demonstrated as one of the most promising technologies to produce green hydrogen.7,8,93 In the two half-reactions, in this case the OER at the anode and the HER at the cathode, the OER is regarded as the bottleneck in the overall water splitting process due to a four-electron transfer process with sluggish reaction kinetics.11,14 Particularly, earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts enable high efficiency in the alkaline water electrolysis process. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to designing nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts, especially OER electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis.16,94–97 For example, Co–B is a popular electrocatalyst in the form of powders for the application of water splitting. However, the report of nanostructured Co–B thin film by PLD as the anode catalyst for water splitting is rare. Patel et al. synthesized Co–B thin film by PLD. After the electrochemical reaction, the bulk of the thin film is metallic, while the surface is enriched with CoOOH species as the active sites. As a result, the Co–B thin film can generate a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of 280 mV, showing a remarkable activity advantage compared to the powder catalyst.98 Mixed transition metal-based materials also show great potential for electrocatalysis. Later, the same group synthesized Co–Fe–B–O thin film deposited on a fluorine tin oxide substrate. Particularly, they evaluated the morphology and crystallinity by tuning the annealing temperatures (room temperature, 200, 400, and 600 °C in air). The sample annealed at 400 °C exhibited good OER catalytic activity toward the OER with an overpotential of 315 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 31.5 mV dec−1. It was found that B facilitated the formation of Co3+ active sites (CoOOH) by preventing the complete oxidation of Co. Meanwhile, Fe helped to reduce Co3+ to Co2+, thus completing the Co2+/Co3+ redox cycle.99 OER electrocatalysts in acidic media Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers have been regarded as a more promising hydrogen production technique (e.g., higher voltage efficiency and hydrogen purity) compared to alkaline water electrolyzers.15,66,100–102 It remains a great challenge to use transition metal-based materials as high-performance OER electrocatalysts in acidic conditions, mainly due to the serious dissolution of transition metal ions under corrosive conditions.66,94,103,104 At present, state-of-the-art acidic OER electrocatalysts still rely on Ru- and Ir-based materials.15,105–109 It should be noted that applications of metal-based materials toward the OER in acidic environments always involve surface reconstruction, which will be also highlighted as an effective strategy to design advanced electrocatalysts.110 Thin films represent useful model systems to study operational stability during the electrochemical reaction. Herein, we focus the discussion on recent developments related to SrIrO3 thin films to characterize and fundamentally study the acidic OER process. Iridium-based perovskite oxides are highly active acidic OER electrocatalysts, associated with the selective leaching of A-site cations under OER conditions.105,106,111 Seitz et al.112 used the PLD technique to deposit SrIrO3 thin film on SrTiO3 (100) substrates. The electrochemically induced IrOx/SrIrO3 exhibited excellent OER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 (maintaining OER activity at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with an overpotential of 270–290 mV for 30 h), exceeding that of conventional IrOx and RuOx catalysts (Figure 4a,b). The active site was ascribed to the surface Ir-rich overlayer due to Sr leaching at the surface (Figure 4c). Figure 4 | (a) Galvanostatic measurements of IrOx/SrIrO3 thin films.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Later, Jaramillo et al.113 investigated catalyst degradation mechanisms for the same material system (crystalline SrIrO3 (001) thin films grown epitaxially onto SrTiO3 (001) substrates) using advanced nanoscale microscopy techniques, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) for the identification of the crystal structure and homogeneity as well as a helium ion microscope with secondary ion mass spectrometry for chemical imaging at a nanometer level and elemental specificity. Furthermore, with the assistance of other physical and chemical characterization methods (e.g., X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, grazing-incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy), a three-dimensional picture of the catalyst before and after the OER process revealed that the initial degradation mechanism was layer-wise dissolution, wherein Sr leaching and Ir dissolution lead to an IrOx-rich active layer and a bulk structure (Figure 4d–g). As a result, a layer-by-layer degradation mechanism was proposed. Compared to high-performance catalysts in the form of nanoparticles and porous supports, thin films of SrIrO3 provide a good platform to study surface reconstruction at the nanoscale. Wan et al.114 studied the amorphization mechanism of SrIrO3 with a thin film model of SrIrO3 grown on a DyScO3 (110) substrate along the (001) orientation. In particular, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray reflection (XRR) methods were used to identify the crystalline-to-amorphous transformation process (Figure 4h). Furthermore, combined with grazing incidence X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, local geometry/coordination and electronic structure changes in the amorphous and crystalline layers of SrIrO3 were tracked (Figure 4i–k). As a result, the initial formation of amorphous SryIrOx with primarily Ir square-planar motifs and a second-stage transformation of a highly disordered structure consisting of Ir4+ octahedra were revealed, providing a standpoint from which to understand how oxygen redox initiates ionic diffusion and surface reconstruction processes. HER electrocatalysts The reaction rate of the HER at the cathode during the electrochemical water splitting process also has a significant effect on the device efficiency.13,115,116 Among non-noble metal-based HER catalysts, transition-metal dichalcogenides have been the subject of much attention due to their remarkable catalytic activities.117 Particularly, molybdenum sulfide is considered to be a promising alternative to Pt-based materials toward the HER.118 Giuffredi et al.88 fabricated MoSx nanostructured films by PLD, which exhibited the distinguishing features of highly defective clusters with a metastable structure. In this work, the relationship between the final morphology and structure of the synthesized materials and the tailored parameters related to PLD set-up was described. The new phase formation of a conductive MoO2 shell, amorphous molybdenum oxysulfide, and an optimal mesostructure jointly contributed to the superior HER activity with a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec−1 and low overpotentials at high current densities (e.g., overpotentials of 126, 170, and 550 mV to obtain 10, 100, and 500 mA cm−2 current densities, respectively). Remarkably, the hierarchical nanoarchitectures are capable of exposing considerable active sites and improving the conductivity to more readily facilitate the HER process. Another work by Wang et al.119 reported the direct growth of high-ratio 1T MoS2 thin films by PLD, showing enhanced HER activity. Different amounts of sulfur were added to a MoS2 target to modulate the 1T MoS2 ratio in the synthesized thin films. The introduction of sulfur facilitated the formation of pores on the films. Moreover, the optimized thin film provided more active sites and exhibited high metallic conductivity. Benefiting from these advantages, HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a low Tafel slope of 38 mV dec−1 and a small overpotential of 151 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was achieved for the high-content 1T-phase MoS2 thin film, even outperforming MoS2 powder. Oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a crucial step in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.120,121 ORR activity is commonly evaluated by the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique. Due to the square shape and insulating nature of some substrates, the electrocatalytic activity of thin films for the ORR is assessed by sampled current voltammetry. In addition, a self-supported electrode can be attached to the glassy carbon insert of an RDE using silver paste.122 Similar to the OER, the ORR is also kinetically sluggish. Commercial Pt/C has been regarded as the benchmark electrocatalyst for the ORR. Decreasing the consumption of noble metals while simultaneously improving the ORR activity and stability is the main task when designing Pt-based electrocatalysts. Mohamedi et al.123 synthesized Mn2O3/Pt/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a two-step process. Pt was initially deposited onto CNTs with an ultralow loading of Pt and further coated with a porous Mn2O3 layer, achieving a layer-on-layer architecture. Electrochemical testing revealed that the Mn2O3/Pt/CNTs exhibited ORR activity identical to that of Pt in alkaline media. Moreover, the bilayer catalyst showed high tolerance to the methanol oxidation reaction, an outcome attributed to the synergistic effect of the two active sites. Ag-based materials are potential alternatives to Pt-based ORR catalysts due to their relatively high abundance, low cost and good stability. Related to this, Zhao et al.122 showcased the modulation of the pressure of the background gas (Ar) to tailor the structure of as-deposited Ag thin films. More specifically, when the Ar pressure was held to a low (0.5 Pa) an",renewables,['2958-1893'],journal,20,[],Sun,,False,

Due to their versatility, they are used in numerous fields, such as industry, science or medicine. Introduction of an optical microsphere with zinc oxide (ZnO) coating applied by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) on its surface, allows for constant monitoring of the integrity of the structure. This feature is especially important during long-term measurements and sensing in the remote and hard-to-reach places. This study presents preparation of the microsphere-based fiber-optic sensor, characterization of the ALD ZnO coatings and an experimental setup operating as an interferometer in reflective mode, which was used to obtain the results of refractive index and temperature measurements. The signal generated by a low-coherent light source passes through an optical coupler to a microsphere-based fiber-optic sensor head, placed in a measured medium, where it reflects and travels to a detector. Interferometric signal is used to control whether the microstructure is whole. The intensity of reflected signal is used to conclude changes in measured parameter.

Urbanos, Aarón Díaz, L. Reséndiz, Jan Ingo Flege, Daniel Granados, L. Soriano","Carbon fibers, Oxidation state","The role of the oxidation state of carbon on the early stages of growth of metal oxides was studied for the particular case of ZnO deposition on graphene and graphene oxide on SiO2 (G/SiO2 and GO/SiO2, respectively) substrates. The growth was carried out by thermal evaporation of metallic Zn under an oxygen atmosphere at room temperature. This technique permits quasi-equilibrium conditions during the oxide growth, allowing the characterization of the fundamental interaction between ZnO and the graphene-based substrates. Although in both cases ZnO follows a Volmer–Weber growth mode controlled by nucleation at defects, the details are different. In the case of the GO/SiO2 substrate, the nucleation process acts as a bottleneck, limiting the coverage of the complete surface and allowing the growth of very large ZnO structures in comparison to G/SiO2. Moreover, by studying the Zn-LMM Auger spectra, it is shown how the initial nature of the substrate influences the composition of the ZnO deposit during the very early stages of growth in terms of Zn/O atomic ratio. These results are compared to those previously reported regarding ZnO growth on graphite and graphene on Cu (G/Cu).

The presence of an intermediate layer between metallic nanoparticles and substrate significantly promotes the adhesion and reduces the surface roughness. In this article, we have investigated the effect of Chromium (Cr) seed layer to optimize the surface roughness on the growth of as-deposited silver (Ag) film using borosilicate glass and silicon wafer substrates. For this purpose, Ag thin films were deposited with a Cr seed layer of different thickness on borosilicate glass and silicon wafer substrates using an electron beam (E-Beam) deposition method. The Cr thin film of different thickness ranging from 1 nm to 6 nm was thermally evaporated and pure Ag with the same thickness was evaporated at the same rate on previously coated substrates. The deposition of the nanostructured thin film was confirmed by UV-Vis and XRD characterizations. The difference in transmittance for uncoated and coated substrates ensured the deposition. The presence of pure Ag crystalline phase was confirmed by XRD pattern. Surface roughness was measured using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the conductance was measured using 4-probe conductivity method. The density of nanoparticles and smoothness were visualized from two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) surface height histograms of representative AFM images. The quantitative roughness was measured in terms of root mean square (RMS) roughness and mean roughness. The high dense and smoother thin films were found for ~2-4 nm Cr layer thickness in case of the glass substrate. The slight increase in roughness was observed for ~1-6 nm Cr layer thickness in case of the silicon substrate. The dependence of the conductivity of thin films on surface roughness is investigated to verify the effect of surface roughness on different applications of Ag thin film. The conductance results have been analyzed as; for a glass substrate, conductivity was maximum for thin films containing ~2 nm Cr seed layer thickness, while for silicon substrate the maximum conductivity was found for the thin film containing ~1 nm Cr seed layer.",journal of the chemical society of pakistan,['0253-5106'],journal,7,[],Abbas,,False,

This systematic review comprehensively appraises technologies, strategies, and water pollution control policies enacted in different countries worldwide between 2055 and 2021. Five databases, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar and Library of Congress, were used for the search. After screening, a total of 86 eligible manuscripts were selected from 2119 documents for further analysis. Selected articles were divided into two categories: (1) articles introducing the strategies enacted for controlling water pollution based on different technologies, and (2) articles that focused on different policies and regulations to control water pollution in different countries. The results indicated that the most common technologies are Eco-Remediation, Aquatic Vegetation Restoration Technology, Bio-Manipulation Technology, Floating Aquatic-Plant Bed Systems, Wetlands Rehabilitation Technology and Adsorption Technology. And the current one is Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Most of these technologies are related to controlling industrial water pollution. Policies and regulations enacted in most countries are pertinent to the industrial and agricultural sectors. Adopting green industrialisation and farming, particularly elimination or limited use of pesticides, was reported as an effective action by governments to reduce water pollution. Overall, most policies enacted by governments can be divided into two general categories: (a) Prescriptive policies (b) Market-Based policies. Depending on the circumstances, these policies are implemented alone or jointly. In addition to the acceptance of international agreements to reduce water pollution by governments, safe agricultural practices, treating industrial waste before discharge play an important role in reducing water pollution.",research square (research square),,repository,1,"['https://openalex.org/W1580771424', 'https://openalex.org/W1953261981', 'https://openalex.org/W1990993966', 'https://openalex.org/W1991578333', 'https://openalex.org/W1996427767', 'https://openalex.org/W2015027435', 'https://openalex.org/W2037278904', 'https://openalex.org/W2038336268', 'https://openalex.org/W2043697498', 'https://openalex.org/W2049119807', 'https://openalex.org/W2058406447', 'https://openalex.org/W2065801653', 'https://openalex.org/W2067240216', 'https://openalex.org/W2082626925', 'https://openalex.org/W2083886153', 'https://openalex.org/W2095687381', 'https://openalex.org/W2156785876', 'https://openalex.org/W2172043276', 'https://openalex.org/W2184480527', 'https://openalex.org/W2195357451', 'https://openalex.org/W2317855079', 'https://openalex.org/W2374202622', 'https://openalex.org/W2469248826', 'https://openalex.org/W2470983413', 'https://openalex.org/W2512026164', 'https://openalex.org/W2512035795', 'https://openalex.org/W2518239443', 'https://openalex.org/W2584679338', 'https://openalex.org/W2759229267', 'https://openalex.org/W2781946532', 'https://openalex.org/W2793704869', 'https://openalex.org/W2887921416', 'https://openalex.org/W2897059091', 'https://openalex.org/W2897501811', 'https://openalex.org/W2922395279', 'https://openalex.org/W2924191103', 'https://openalex.org/W2957997269', 'https://openalex.org/W2964442111', 'https://openalex.org/W2986750392', 'https://openalex.org/W2988304271', 'https://openalex.org/W3006858981', 'https://openalex.org/W3008499789', 'https://openalex.org/W3008671703', 'https://openalex.org/W3017161929', 'https://openalex.org/W3021222761', 'https://openalex.org/W3026032858', 'https://openalex.org/W3037160830', 'https://openalex.org/W3043092084', 'https://openalex.org/W3047326925', 'https://openalex.org/W3047697424', 'https://openalex.org/W3049701598', 'https://openalex.org/W3079581722', 'https://openalex.org/W3092354749', 'https://openalex.org/W3094648600', 'https://openalex.org/W3096770434', 'https://openalex.org/W3122507110', 'https://openalex.org/W3125121093', 'https://openalex.org/W3128359895', 'https://openalex.org/W3160628178', 'https://openalex.org/W3174615194', 'https://openalex.org/W3183945195', 'https://openalex.org/W3199779401', 'https://openalex.org/W3202742164', 'https://openalex.org/W4239748798', 'https://openalex.org/W4256581410', 'https://openalex.org/W4291215253', 'https://openalex.org/W4294215472']",Abdallah,,False,

In this work, we synthesized a positive-tone hybrid photoresist composed of PMMA infiltrated with molecular network of indium oxide by vapor-phase infiltration (VPI), an ex-situ inorganic hybridization method derived from atomic layer deposition, and evaluated its patterning characteristics by electron-beam and EUV lithography (EBL and EUVL). The hybrid resist featured significantly enhanced etch resistance under dry etching but also the critical doses of 300 uC/cm2 for EBL and 60 mJ/cm2 for EUVL, both largely comparable to those of PMMA. Unlike alumina infiltration in PMMA that has been demonstrated previously, it was found that the weak binding nature of trimethyl indium (TMIn), the gaseous precursor used to infiltrate indium oxide in PMMA matrix, to the carbonyl group in PMMA enabled a uniform distribution of the oxide content across the PMMA thickness. However, it also led to undesired residue in the developed regions due to the strong interaction between the Lewis-basic hydroxyl groups on the surface of starting Si substrate with infiltrated TMIn. The residue issue could be mitigated by passivating the Si surface by hexamethyldisilizane (HMDS) and combining the acid/base rinse and oxygen plasma descum. The results not only hint at the potential of VPI-based ex-situ hybridization in developing novel hybrid EUV photoresists but also highlight the technological details that must be addressed to enable high EUVL performance in the infiltrated hybrid resist system.",,,,1,[],Subramanian,,False,

However, low lithium metal Coulombic efficiency and charge loss due to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation severely limit the cycle life of anode-free SSBs. Here, we explore ultra-thin (5–20 nm) Al 2 O 3 and ZnO coatings deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on copper electrodes for anode-free cells with a solid polymer electrolyte. Voltammetry shows that lithium inventory loss from SEI formation is reduced over 50% with Al 2 O 3 @Cu electrodes, but these electrodes experience orders of magnitude higher interface resistances than bare Cu and ZnO@Cu electrodes due to low ionic and electronic conductivities. The electrochemical differences are reflected in XPS, where Al 2 O 3 undergoes a self-limiting lithiation reaction with Li 0 , while ZnO reacts completely with Li 0 to form LiZn and Li 2 O. These chemical differences result in higher and lower lithium plating nucleation overpotentials for Al 2 O 3 (up to 220 mV) and ZnO (down to 15 mV) coatings, respectively, relative to uncoated Cu electrodes (35 mV). ToF-SIMS reveals lithium plating underneath a Li y AlO x coating and through emergent defects and pinholes with Al 2 O 3 @Cu electrodes, while it plates exclusively on top of converted ZnO@Cu electrodes. SEM corroborates these mechanisms, showing sparse coverage of isolated Li clusters plated with Al 2 O 3 @Cu electrodes, while Cu and ZnO@Cu grow more dense and interconnected deposits. Despite both coatings improving different aspects of anode-free battery design, unmodified Cu electrodes show higher Coulombic efficiencies (∼77%) than Al 2 O 3 @Cu (up to 70%) and ZnO@Cu (up to 75%) electrodes. Increasing Al 2 O 3 thickness decreases the practical current density compared to unmodified Cu (30 µA/cm 2 ), but increasing ZnO thicknesses can double or triple this value.

The presence of an intermediate layer between metallic nanoparticles and substrate significantly promotes the adhesion and reduces the surface roughness. In this article, we have investigated the effect of Chromium (Cr) seed layer to optimize the surface roughness on the growth of as-deposited silver (Ag) film using borosilicate glass and silicon wafer substrates. For this purpose, Ag thin films were deposited with a Cr seed layer of different thickness on borosilicate glass and silicon wafer substrates using an electron beam (E-Beam) deposition method. The Cr thin film of different thickness ranging from 1 nm to 6 nm was thermally evaporated and pure Ag with the same thickness was evaporated at the same rate on previously coated substrates. The deposition of the nanostructured thin film was confirmed by UV-Vis and XRD characterizations. The difference in transmittance for uncoated and coated substrates ensured the deposition. The presence of pure Ag crystalline phase was confirmed by XRD pattern. Surface roughness was measured using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the conductance was measured using 4-probe conductivity method. The density of nanoparticles and smoothness were visualized from two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) surface height histograms of representative AFM images. The quantitative roughness was measured in terms of root mean square (RMS) roughness and mean roughness. The high dense and smoother thin films were found for ~2-4 nm Cr layer thickness in case of the glass substrate. The slight increase in roughness was observed for ~1-6 nm Cr layer thickness in case of the silicon substrate. The dependence of the conductivity of thin films on surface roughness is investigated to verify the effect of surface roughness on different applications of Ag thin film. The conductance results have been analyzed as; for a glass substrate, conductivity was maximum for thin films containing ~2 nm Cr seed layer thickness, while for silicon substrate the maximum conductivity was found for the thin film containing ~1 nm Cr seed layer.",journal of the chemical society of pakistan,['0253-5106'],journal,6,[],Abbas,,False,

Wolbach, Allen West","Shock metamorphism, Coesite","A previous investigation revealed that shock-fracturing, a form of low-pressure shock metamorphism in quartz grains, can be produced during near-surface atomic airbursts and in cosmic impact structures, most likely at pressures lower than 8 GPa. This discovery implies that similar shock-fracturing may also form in quartz grains exposed to near-surface airbursts by comets and asteroids. Here, we investigate this hypothesis by examining quartz grains in a sedimentary profile from Abu Hureyra, a prehistoric archaeological site in northern Syria. This site was previously proposed to have experienced a nearby, low-altitude cosmic airburst at the onset of the Younger Dryas (~12,800 years ago). The Younger Dryas boundary layer (YDB) at Abu Hureyra has previously been shown to contain a rich assemblage of materials consistent in indicating a cosmic impact. These include anomalously high concentrations of melted micro-spherules displaying increased remanent magnetism; meltglass with low water content indicative of high-temperature melting; nanodiamonds, potentially including lonsdaleite; carbon spherules produced by biomass burning; black carbon or soot; total organic carbon; and abnormally high-temperature melted refractory minerals and elements, including platinum, iridium, chromite, and zircon. To further test this impact hypothesis, we searched for evidence of shocked quartz, a robust, widely accepted indicator of cosmic impacts. We used a comprehensive analytical suite of high-resolution techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), to examine and characterize quartz grains from the YDB layer at Abu Hureyra. Our analyses revealed the presence of quartz grains with sub-planar, sub-parallel, and sub-micron-wide intragranular fractures, most likely produced by mechanical and thermal shock or the combination of both. Furthermore, these fractures are typically filled with amorphous silica (glass), a classic indicator of shock metamorphism. Elemental analyses of the weight percentages of oxygen in the amorphous silica indicate that this could not have formed from the deposition of hydrated silica (e.g., opal and hyalite), which is enhanced in oxygen. Instead, the silica we observed is typically depleted in oxygen, consistent with melting under highly reducing conditions. The shock fractures in quartz grains also display Dauphiné twinning, which sometimes develops during the stress of high temperatures or pressures. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the glass-filled fractures in quartz grains were produced by thermal and mechanical shock during a near-surface cosmic airburst at Abu Hureyra. These glass-filled fractures closely resemble those formed in near-surface atomic airbursts and crater-forming impact events.",airbursts and cratering impacts,['2941-9085'],journal,10,"['https://openalex.org/W1531186631', 'https://openalex.org/W1582280943', 'https://openalex.org/W1604039151', 'https://openalex.org/W1656168019', 'https://openalex.org/W1963600106', 'https://openalex.org/W1965073501', 'https://openalex.org/W1967768164', 'https://openalex.org/W1973138394', 'https://openalex.org/W1977657589', 'https://openalex.org/W1979259193', 'https://openalex.org/W1986576422', 'https://openalex.org/W1987789528', 'https://openalex.org/W1990848196', 'https://openalex.org/W1998769902', 'https://openalex.org/W2008797959', 'https://openalex.org/W2014593285', 'https://openalex.org/W2028030658', 'https://openalex.org/W2030212341', 'https://openalex.org/W2032959179', 'https://openalex.org/W2038079442', 'https://openalex.org/W2039586614', 'https://openalex.org/W2040303203', 'https://openalex.org/W2041784109', 'https://openalex.org/W2045073165', 'https://openalex.org/W2053003389', 'https://openalex.org/W2053848315', 'https://openalex.org/W2055355681', 'https://openalex.org/W2055639020', 'https://openalex.org/W2066280356', 'https://openalex.org/W2067455730', 'https://openalex.org/W2071180661', 'https://openalex.org/W2075240417', 'https://openalex.org/W2076597914', 'https://openalex.org/W2092019896', 'https://openalex.org/W2094640691', 'https://openalex.org/W2095310892', 'https://openalex.org/W2099149056', 'https://openalex.org/W2101337753', 'https://openalex.org/W2112914804', 'https://openalex.org/W2130179383', 'https://openalex.org/W2132731639', 'https://openalex.org/W2137184201', 'https://openalex.org/W2150087475', 'https://openalex.org/W2152211844', 'https://openalex.org/W2154255501', 'https://openalex.org/W2155645894', 'https://openalex.org/W2156191039', 'https://openalex.org/W2158275250', 'https://openalex.org/W2183983572', 'https://openalex.org/W2184262437', 'https://openalex.org/W2323700042', 'https://openalex.org/W2462820304', 'https://openalex.org/W2489272455', 'https://openalex.org/W2511348892', 'https://openalex.org/W2519494639', 'https://openalex.org/W2531058618', 'https://openalex.org/W2549987468', 'https://openalex.org/W2577196445', 'https://openalex.org/W2593640544', 'https://openalex.org/W2767485895', 'https://openalex.org/W2787250335', 'https://openalex.org/W2787691836', 'https://openalex.org/W2883438382', 'https://openalex.org/W2883834624', 'https://openalex.org/W2885410746', 'https://openalex.org/W2906055332', 'https://openalex.org/W2913862970', 'https://openalex.org/W2920868683', 'https://openalex.org/W2943527272', 'https://openalex.org/W2982068550', 'https://openalex.org/W3009973249', 'https://openalex.org/W3016059982', 'https://openalex.org/W3022410686', 'https://openalex.org/W3031839909', 'https://openalex.org/W3089850530', 'https://openalex.org/W3093419652', 'https://openalex.org/W3113781849', 'https://openalex.org/W3199238525', 'https://openalex.org/W3208482658', 'https://openalex.org/W4295753559', 'https://openalex.org/W4300540921', 'https://openalex.org/W4380628759', 'https://openalex.org/W4385515543', 'https://openalex.org/W4387271267', 'https://openalex.org/W4387293536', 'https://openalex.org/W656163475', 'https://openalex.org/W8632751']",Moore,,False,

Surface topography has also been reported to be influential in some research, although its effect is still not well elucidated. In this study, nano‐roughened polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates were developed through a chemically etched intermediate surface. Additionally, PDMS substrates containing 10–30 μm diameter micropillars were functionalized with multilayers of chitosan (CHI) and hyaluronic acid (HA) via layer‐by‐layer. Such substrates were submitted to cell adhesion assays with PC3 tumour cells. The characterization of these substrates was carried out using an atomic force microscopy (AFM), and some roughness parameters were estimated. Through a statistical description of the topography, we investigated the effects of these surface parameters on PC3 cell adhesion. AFM results indicated a significant modification in the PDMS surface topography and the cell adhesion assays suggest that smoother surfaces induce the PC3 cell adhesion, especially the ones with a high Hurst exponent value. In addition to the AFM analysis, the surface modification of the LbL‐functionalized substrates was monitored by contact angle and UV‐visible measurements. The improved wettability and the significant Alcian Blue absorbance of the functionalized substrates suggest that the HA/CHI film deposition was successfully accomplished. The LbL functionalization increased the cell capture potential of the PDMS substrates, in which lower diameter micropillars favour the cell adhesion mechanism.

First, Cu2O thin films of a typical thickness of 100 nm are deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates by DC-reactive magnetron sputtering, followed by their in-depth characterization with different techniques, including scanning electron and atomic force microscopies, UV-Vis, X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopies, to probe their structural, optical, and morphological properties. Surface topology analysis revealed homogeneous, compact, and uniform sputtered deposited films. The as deposited films layers have shown a preferential crystal orientation of (111) and a stoichiometry of CuO, at the surface, which is believed to be mainly due to the oxidization effect of the non-capsulated surface, while a short-duration argon etching (~ 5 s) has revealed the growth of Cu2O films stoichiometry. Finally, during the reactive plasma deposition, films were grown under nitrogen gas flow to improve their hole-mobility, followed by a systematic annealing at various temperatures ranging from 100 to 250 °C to improve their crystalline structure. Hall effect measurement confirmed that the Cu2O thin film are p-type, with extremely high electronic properties, including an electrical conductivity of 2.6 × 102 S/cm, a hole mobility of about 30 cm2/Vs and a charge carrier density around 5 × 1019 cm-3, making them a serious candidate for a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells.",journal of thin films research,['2581-3811'],journal,7,"['https://openalex.org/W1645526007', 'https://openalex.org/W1972919532', 'https://openalex.org/W1980385603', 'https://openalex.org/W1983939137', 'https://openalex.org/W1986582216', 'https://openalex.org/W1994088971', 'https://openalex.org/W1997675126', 'https://openalex.org/W2003390285', 'https://openalex.org/W2012147645', 'https://openalex.org/W2017078820', 'https://openalex.org/W2022215046', 'https://openalex.org/W2022879044', 'https://openalex.org/W2025541564', 'https://openalex.org/W2046482627', 'https://openalex.org/W2050777265', 'https://openalex.org/W2057490264', 'https://openalex.org/W2058792245', 'https://openalex.org/W2064428037', 'https://openalex.org/W2066800586', 'https://openalex.org/W2070809909', 'https://openalex.org/W2098547240', 'https://openalex.org/W2104574446', 'https://openalex.org/W2108889749', 'https://openalex.org/W2109580066', 'https://openalex.org/W2110787427', 'https://openalex.org/W2117451085', 'https://openalex.org/W2130869344', 'https://openalex.org/W2211884255', 'https://openalex.org/W2222768861', 'https://openalex.org/W2236703275', 'https://openalex.org/W2281492656', 'https://openalex.org/W2490343118', 'https://openalex.org/W4233415058']",Hossain,,False,

De Gregorio, Evgeniya H. Lock, Keith E. Knipling, Hans Cho","Memristor, Niobium oxide, Characterization","Volatile memristor devices are used in neuromorphic computing systems because they mimic the spike action of neurons in the brain [1].A physical artificial neural network can be constructed using threshold (i.e., rapid) switching phase change materials such as TiO 2 or NbO 2 to meet the non-linear and ""short term memory"" requirements for a reservoir computing architecture.In the case of NbO 2 , an induced current applied to the device causes localized Joule heating to enable a reversible insulator-to-metal phase transition between the rutile (R-NbO 2 ; E g = 1 eV) and tetragonal (T-NbO 2 ) crystal structures [2].This phase transition has been shown to be consistent with a Peierls transition model, in which conducting chains of Nb dimers are formed through a small reorganization of NbO 6 octahedra.Practical NbO 2 memristor devices can be constructed using atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth, followed by annealing to generate a final, transitionable, thin film [3].Since Nb-oxide has multiple metastable phases, several Nb 2 O 5 and NbO 2 phase transitions were observed during annealing to form a contiguous NbO 2 thin film [4].Introducing hydrogen plasma exposure in the ALD chamber between successive deposition layers can lead to intermediate NbO x compositions with unique memristor capability.Here we used correlated transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atom-probe tomography (APT) on a set of ALD-deposited Nb-oxide thin films annealed to 800 °C and 1000 °C (for 20 min each), along with an unheated control sample.Cross-sections of each sample were prepared by FIB liftout methods with a ThermoFisher Helios G3 DualBeam FIB-SEM.The distribution of Nb-oxide phases within the thin films were measured by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with an aberration Nion UltraSTEM 200-X, using a Gatan Enfinium EELS spectrometer modified with a Quantun Detectors MerlinEELS direct electron detector.EELS spectrum images were acquired at the Nb N-edge and plasmon (∼20 eV), O K-edge (∼532 eV), Nb L-edge (∼2370 eV).Fine-structure at these EELS edges provides sensitive information about Nb cation coordination and NbO 6 octahedra edge-vs.-cornersharing.Reference EELS spectra exist for the stable rutile R-NbO 2 and monoclinic H-Nb 2 O 5 phases [5], but none of the other metastable phases identified by Twigg et al. [4] in similar ALD-deposited thin films (e.g., T-NbO 2 , T-Nb 2 O 5 , and B-Nb 2 O 5 ).Distinct phases in spectrum images were identified using PCA and cluster analysis with HyperSpy 1.7. 3 [6] Characterization of the unheated sample reveals that three compositions of NbO x were deposited in a multilayer film by plasma-assisted ALD (Figure 1).The first layer (30 nm) at the bottom of the stack is crystalline and shows O-K and Nb-N spectra that match R-NbO 2 .Above this layer is 30 nm of amorphous film, where the O-K spectra of top 15 nm is consistent with the predominantly corner-sharing NbO 6 octahedra of Nb 2 O 5 phases.The O-K spectrum of the middle 15 nm layer does not match either of the two reference spectra, and the broad peak at 540 eV indicates that complex O coordination is present.The fully annealed sample retains the multilayer structure of the initial ALD thin film.Octahedra edge-vs.-cornersharing does not change after annealing, as O K-edge spectra for each layer does not change from the initial thin film.However, the peak distance between Nb L 2 and L 3 peaks does increase by 0.5 eV from crystallization of Nb 2 O 5 .These data indicate that alternate NbO x compositions can be stabilized for memristor devices by H plasma-assisted ALD growth.However, vesicle growth along interlayer boundaries observed by TEM may cause difficulties in memristor switching due to blocking the formation of contiguous phase transformation channels through the device [7].",microscopy and microanalysis,"['1431-9276', '1435-8115']",journal,1,"['https://openalex.org/W2093785304', 'https://openalex.org/W2315206577', 'https://openalex.org/W3012960271', 'https://openalex.org/W3118781828', 'https://openalex.org/W4286634769']",Gregorio,,False,

Wolfman, B. Négulescu, A. Ruyter, Ndioba Niang, Nazir Jaber","Pulsed Laser Deposition, Deposition",In this chapter we will describe a new development of combinatorial pulsed laser deposition (CPLD) which targets the exploration of interface libraries. The idea is to modulate continuously the composition of interfaces on a few atomic layers in order to alter their functional properties. This unique combinatorial synthesis of interfaces is possible due to very specific PLD characteristics. The first one is its well-known ability for complex oxide stoichiometry transfer from the target to the film. The second one is the layer by layer control of thin film growth at the atomic level using in-situ RHEED characterization. The third one relates to the directionality of the ablated plume which allows for selective area deposition on the substrate using a mobile shadow-mask. However PLD also has some limitations and important PLD aspects to be considered for reliable CPLD are reviewed.

The electrochemical deposition pH explored is within the range of (1.00 to 6.00)±0.02 for the aqueous electrolyte comprising of tellurium oxide (TeO2) and cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2) which are the respective precursors of Te and Cd. The optical, structural, morphological, compositional, and electrical properties of the electroplated CdTe thin-films were respectively explored using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell measurements. The optical characterisation show that the CdTe samples exhibit dissimilar absorbance depending on the growth pH for both the as-deposited layers and post-growth treated CdTe layers. A decrease in the absorption edge slope and dip in the bandgap was observed away from pH2. The bandgap of the post-growth treated CdTe layers showed enhancement as it leans towards 1.45 eV, with the trend retention of absorption edge slope, similar to the as-deposited CdTe layers. The electrodeposited CdTe thin-films show a dominant orientation along the cubic (111) CdTe plane, while both the the calculated crystallite size and the XRD peak intensity Pi decreases with the electroplating pH outside the (2.00 to 3.00)±0.02 range. The EDX analyses depicts an alteration in the ratio of Cd to Te atomic percentage relative to the pH of the electrolyte. Comparatively high Te atomic ratio was observed at lower pH values and vice versa with increase alkalinity of the electrolyte. The obtained morphology depicts that the underlying FTO layers are well covered with a gradual reduction in the grain size of the CdTe observable away from pH value (2.00 and 3.00).

Alotaibi, Subhash Ayirala, Igor Sîreţanu, Michael H.G. Duits, Frieder Mugele, Ali A. Yousef",,"Abstract Within reservoirs, spatial variations related to mineralogy and fluid chemistry determine the success of improved oil recovery (IOR) techniques. However, the composition and structure of mineral-adsorbent-fluid interfaces, which fundamentally determine the initial and IOR-altered wettability of reservoir rocks as well as the displacement of crude oil (CRO), are unclear. Replicating the diagenetic alterations of carbonates, this study addresses the temperature dependence of the inorganic and organic modifications of calcite by reservoir pertinent fluids as well as its consequences on mineral wettability and reactivity. We utilize a suite of characterization methods, such as confocal Raman, scanning electron and atomic force microscopy as well as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, to investigate the modifications of carbonates on aging in formation water (FW), CRO-equilibrated FW and FW-equilibrated CRO. The microscopic modifications of carbonates present positive correlations with aging temperature and also are varied, encompassing topographical alterations, cation substitution of lattice Ca2+ ions by Mg2+ ions and the deposition of particles enriched with polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as organic adlayers. Aging in the formation waters produce substantial reconstruction of calcite surfaces, with the formation of Mg-calcite layers at elevated temperatures. Subsequent aging in brine-equilibrated CRO produces an organic coating on calcite surfaces, which is composed of PAH-enriched particles. The organic adlayers, deposited at high temperature, produce a transition in the macroscopic contact angles towards a more ‘oil wet’ tendency. In addition, the organic adlayer presents limited permeability and serves as a diffusion barrier to the reactivity of the bound mineral, as evident from substantially reduced rates of calcite dissolution. The multilayer deposition of organic particles is attributed to an interplay between bulk and surface reactions for interfacially active constituents of CRO. With the enrichment of PAHs even observed for mineral grains within reservoir rocks, the permeability and stability of organic adlayers emerge as key factors determining the wettability of carbonates as well as the diffusion behavior of ionic and molecular species at mineral-fluid interfaces. Results of this study are relevant to multiple aspects of reservoir development and maintenance, encompassing laboratory scale wettability and core flooding experiments, in silico models as well as the advancement of IOR strategies. The observed nano- and microscopic surface alterations of carbonates within reservoir mimetic environments facilitate our understanding of the physicochemical relations between mineralogy and fluid chemistry as well as elucidate the organization of mineral-adsorbent-fluid interfaces within reservoirs.",spe improved oil recovery conference,,conference,6,"['https://openalex.org/W1525768091', 'https://openalex.org/W1572819095', 'https://openalex.org/W1643676121', 'https://openalex.org/W1963757240', 'https://openalex.org/W1965796081', 'https://openalex.org/W1966012243', 'https://openalex.org/W1966508692', 'https://openalex.org/W1975928570', 'https://openalex.org/W1977222162', 'https://openalex.org/W1977597489', 'https://openalex.org/W1978225169', 'https://openalex.org/W1979177298', 'https://openalex.org/W1986392440', 'https://openalex.org/W1990407083', 'https://openalex.org/W1992530481', 'https://openalex.org/W1998326070', 'https://openalex.org/W1998750825', 'https://openalex.org/W2004797828', 'https://openalex.org/W2004803783', 'https://openalex.org/W2007830908', 'https://openalex.org/W2009212043', 'https://openalex.org/W2009499453', 'https://openalex.org/W2011603996', 'https://openalex.org/W2013375804', 'https://openalex.org/W2015257502', 'https://openalex.org/W2015721634', 'https://openalex.org/W2017918382', 'https://openalex.org/W2018969365', 'https://openalex.org/W2022069733', 'https://openalex.org/W2027356372', 'https://openalex.org/W2027854569', 'https://openalex.org/W2030994386', 'https://openalex.org/W2031925144', 'https://openalex.org/W2049814818', 'https://openalex.org/W2050468011', 'https://openalex.org/W2050995819', 'https://openalex.org/W2055837754', 'https://openalex.org/W2061175852', 'https://openalex.org/W2062313247', 'https://openalex.org/W2063463109', 'https://openalex.org/W2064361554', 'https://openalex.org/W2069672475', 'https://openalex.org/W2071246790', 'https://openalex.org/W2073115664', 'https://openalex.org/W2074321084', 'https://openalex.org/W2076301558', 'https://openalex.org/W2079032830', 'https://openalex.org/W2084128464', 'https://openalex.org/W2087235777', 'https://openalex.org/W2087531232', 'https://openalex.org/W2097598596', 'https://openalex.org/W2109687987', 'https://openalex.org/W2121205524', 'https://openalex.org/W2137939503', 'https://openalex.org/W2138736613', 'https://openalex.org/W2150295685', 'https://openalex.org/W2163983728', 'https://openalex.org/W2168649638', 'https://openalex.org/W2169070796', 'https://openalex.org/W2252206314', 'https://openalex.org/W2274540427', 'https://openalex.org/W2292097359', 'https://openalex.org/W2313013454', 'https://openalex.org/W2316455723', 'https://openalex.org/W2316808843', 'https://openalex.org/W2325058997', 'https://openalex.org/W2326223782', 'https://openalex.org/W2328246523', 'https://openalex.org/W2335498425', 'https://openalex.org/W2345936095', 'https://openalex.org/W2470206001', 'https://openalex.org/W2477290316', 'https://openalex.org/W2487862583', 'https://openalex.org/W2543009903', 'https://openalex.org/W2548891540', 'https://openalex.org/W2553898999', 'https://openalex.org/W2567368059', 'https://openalex.org/W2573985446', 'https://openalex.org/W2598028486', 'https://openalex.org/W2613748217', 'https://openalex.org/W2733805293', 'https://openalex.org/W2747799309', 'https://openalex.org/W2751509527', 'https://openalex.org/W2751651427', 'https://openalex.org/W2806545366', 'https://openalex.org/W2810957618', 'https://openalex.org/W2905523798', 'https://openalex.org/W2938114882', 'https://openalex.org/W2941825081', 'https://openalex.org/W2947976493', 'https://openalex.org/W2963608916', 'https://openalex.org/W2964945564', 'https://openalex.org/W2982827138', 'https://openalex.org/W2986251043', 'https://openalex.org/W3000216058', 'https://openalex.org/W3014355492', 'https://openalex.org/W3015710145', 'https://openalex.org/W3025809008', 'https://openalex.org/W4239396077', 'https://openalex.org/W4241868443', 'https://openalex.org/W595052258', 'https://openalex.org/W620569559', 'https://openalex.org/W623580817', 'https://openalex.org/W658733149', 'https://openalex.org/W659468049']",Rao,,False,

The zirconium precursor solution was maintained as constant, whereas the TiO2 solution composition was modified with two different types of polymers, which were added separately to the starting titanium solution. The phase composition, morphology and corrosion protective properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Hydrophobicity properties were evaluated by measuring the contact angle with a Ramé-Hart automated goniometer. The potentiodynamic polarization technique was used to determine the corrosion resistance and protective ability of the coatings in a 5% NaCl solution. Both polymeric modifications, as compared to the non-modified titania layer, demonstrated positive effects on the corrosion properties of the structures at conditions of external polarization. Due to the amorphous structure of the zirconia layer and its relatively dense, hydrophobic surface, all of the samples extended the service life of low-carbon steel in a model corrosion medium.

Domain intergrowth leads to the formation of homogeneous single-layer MoS_2 films. The Raman spectra of the synthesized films contain two characteristic peaks corresponding to the atomic vibrations in MoS_2 and WS_2. Photoluminescence of the single-layer and bilayer MoS_2 films with a maximum intensity of 670 ± 2 nm and of the single-layer WS_2 films with a maximum intensity of 630 ± 2 nm is detected. The photoluminescence spectral maps (the dependences of the photoluminescence intensity on the luminescence and excitation-light wavelengths) are measured. According to the measured data, the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of MoS_2 has a maximum at 350 ± 5 nm and the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of WS_2 has a maximum at 330 ± 5 nm.

The thickness and the composition of the absorber layer were controlled in situ. NaF post deposition treatment were applied to the absorber layer. The addition of tellurium improved the crystal quality by increasing the average grain size and decreased the surface roughness. Decreasing surface roughness increased reflection and thus decreased the amount of sunlight absorbed, which in turn reduced current collection. Open-circuit voltage was effected by impurity level and the grain boundry recombination. While moderate tellurium addition reduced grain boundary recombination, excessive tellurium addition created stress, caused crack formation, and increased recombination by reducing crystal quality.

The deposition of ITO films and carbon nanotubes was carried out by laser-oriented method using a CO2 laser. The optical scheme was matched to the control electric grid; the strength of the electric field was varied in the range of 100–600 Vcm–1. To analyze the surface, atomic force microscopy in the contact mode and measurement of the wetting angle by sessile drop method was used. Roughness of pure ITO was about 1.8 nm, while in laser-vacuum deposition of carbon nanotubes, roughness varied from 6.4 nm to 22.1 nm with an increase in the electric field during deposition. The relationship between roughness and surface area of coatings and the wetting angle was considered. An increase in the wetting angle from 101.8 degrees, in the case of pure ITO, to 115.0-128.6 degrees, with the deposition of carbon nanotubes, was shown. The results obtained indicate an improvement in the resistance of ITO coatings to moisture during the deposition of carbon nanotubes, which makes it possible to expand their operating conditions and scope in optical electronics, laser and display technology.",image journal of advanced materials and technologies,"['2782-2192', '2782-2206']",journal,1,"['https://openalex.org/W2770701348', 'https://openalex.org/W2788041188', 'https://openalex.org/W2789116913', 'https://openalex.org/W2790152787', 'https://openalex.org/W2799490453', 'https://openalex.org/W2884535912', 'https://openalex.org/W2908274375', 'https://openalex.org/W2923065756', 'https://openalex.org/W2924053018', 'https://openalex.org/W2938583617', 'https://openalex.org/W2945375085', 'https://openalex.org/W2947033454', 'https://openalex.org/W2947554033', 'https://openalex.org/W2953257118', 'https://openalex.org/W2958231192', 'https://openalex.org/W2960150880', 'https://openalex.org/W2963720947', 'https://openalex.org/W2969610551', 'https://openalex.org/W2972139998', 'https://openalex.org/W2974137325', 'https://openalex.org/W2981128620', 'https://openalex.org/W2983220202', 'https://openalex.org/W2990077629', 'https://openalex.org/W3009509532', 'https://openalex.org/W3031204892', 'https://openalex.org/W3042743316', 'https://openalex.org/W3092747795', 'https://openalex.org/W3094055394', 'https://openalex.org/W3110766645', 'https://openalex.org/W3119907058', 'https://openalex.org/W3119932062', 'https://openalex.org/W3120394906', 'https://openalex.org/W3125100562', 'https://openalex.org/W3126715711', 'https://openalex.org/W3132376625', 'https://openalex.org/W3133971819', 'https://openalex.org/W3139113666', 'https://openalex.org/W3156567305', 'https://openalex.org/W3157058541', 'https://openalex.org/W3177408564', 'https://openalex.org/W3197309186', 'https://openalex.org/W3199248996', 'https://openalex.org/W3199859997', 'https://openalex.org/W3202884717', 'https://openalex.org/W4200445033', 'https://openalex.org/W4210633169', 'https://openalex.org/W4403219544']",Toikka,,False,

However, the large-scale growth of h-BN with high quality is still challenging. In this work, we designed an efficient chemical vapor deposition method to grow highly crystalline h-BN films on copper foil substrates on a large scale and investigated the corresponding performances as a protective coating against oxidation and corrosion. Compared to bare copper foil, the copper foil with h-BN film exhibits excellent oxidation resistance even at 300 °C in an ambient atmosphere. The corrosion current in an aqueous electrolyte is obviously depressed by the h-BN coating layer, which can be attributed to the introduction of a hydrophobic surface and larger impedance value.

However, they still present several technological challenges, such as the development of ohmic contacts. The most common contact technology is based on the deposition of metals on the TMDC and subsequent annealing. It is known that this process damages the crystalline structure of the TMDC, leading to Fermi level pinning at the contact interface (Schottky barrier). In this work we explore an easy-to-implement ohmic contact for TMDC solar cells, in which a very flat metal surface has been prepatterned on the substrate and the TMDC laminae are transferred onto it. The TMDC atomic layers remain intact, and they are joined to the metal surface only by van der Waals forces. If a metal of suitable working function is chosen, an ohmic contact is produced without the need of thermal annealing. Using the transfer length method (TLM) we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain contact resistances in the order of 1.10-3Ω. cm2 for n and p doped MoS2, which means that this simple fabrication method for van der Waals metal/TMDC contacts produces sufficiently low series resistance for one-sun applications.",2022 ieee 49th photovoltaics specialists conference (pvsc),,conference,2,[],Martinez,,False,

This paper reports a new approach to fabricating a solar cell using a Superstrate and Substrate configuration. We utilized a non-vacuum deposition process to deposit Copper Zinc Tin Sulfate (CZTS) and Cadmium Sulphate (CdS) on a glass substrate. To achieve this, we adopted the sol-gel spin coating method for CZTS and the Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) method for the CdS layer. The solar cell has two structures: ITO/Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS/Ag for substrate configuration and ITO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4/Ag for superstrate configuration. The Cu/(Zn+Sn) atomic ratio was set to 0.86, while Zn/Sn was set to 1.25. Our CZTS/CdS solar cell achieved a 48.7 × 10-6 % power conversion efficiency with a 1.40 eV band gap and 98.71 % external quantum efficiency at 373 nm for the superstrate configuration. For the substrate configuration, the power conversion efficiency was 19.0 × 10-6 % with a 1.49 eV bandgap and 95.74 % external quantum efficiency at 321 nm. Based on the results presented in the text, the CZTS solar cell with a superstrate configuration achieved a higher power conversion efficiency and external quantum efficiency than the substrate configuration. The superstrate configuration allowed for better light absorption in the CZTS layer and reduced the reflection of light back into the substrate. This configuration also prevented the back diffusion of CdS into CZTS and improved the electrical performance of the solar cell. Therefore, the superstrate configuration is more efficient than the substrate configuration for CZTS solar cells.",jurnal riset dan kajian pendidikan fisika,['2355-620X'],journal,1,"['https://openalex.org/W1548834811', 'https://openalex.org/W1572378215', 'https://openalex.org/W1957401081', 'https://openalex.org/W1979583260', 'https://openalex.org/W1980216394', 'https://openalex.org/W2005701554', 'https://openalex.org/W2029637177', 'https://openalex.org/W2040875144', 'https://openalex.org/W2056523238', 'https://openalex.org/W2061689131', 'https://openalex.org/W2063581749', 'https://openalex.org/W2081590770', 'https://openalex.org/W2093792795', 'https://openalex.org/W2111480398', 'https://openalex.org/W2181679836', 'https://openalex.org/W2232336278', 'https://openalex.org/W2280467629', 'https://openalex.org/W2287244756', 'https://openalex.org/W2332350518', 'https://openalex.org/W2588090632', 'https://openalex.org/W2765146303', 'https://openalex.org/W2790501428', 'https://openalex.org/W2807813690', 'https://openalex.org/W2891681544', 'https://openalex.org/W2914609761', 'https://openalex.org/W2952130334', 'https://openalex.org/W2980708699', 'https://openalex.org/W2994458911', 'https://openalex.org/W3001628442', 'https://openalex.org/W3023590995', 'https://openalex.org/W3039828764', 'https://openalex.org/W3040510581', 'https://openalex.org/W3046754934', 'https://openalex.org/W3047594560', 'https://openalex.org/W3092192156', 'https://openalex.org/W3105947677', 'https://openalex.org/W3133698286', 'https://openalex.org/W3143142885', 'https://openalex.org/W3201641707', 'https://openalex.org/W3211807550', 'https://openalex.org/W4240603146', 'https://openalex.org/W4311469697']",Prima,,False,

Индутный,Diffraction efficiency,"Detailed studies of the efficiency of excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPP) on aluminum gratings with a period a = 694 nm, which exceeds the incident wavelength of λ = 632,8 nm, have been carried out. The gratings relief depth (h) range was 6–135 nm. Research samples were formed on As40S30Se30 chalcogenide photoresist films using interference lithography and vacuum thermal deposition of an opaque aluminum layer about 80 nm thick. An atomic force microscope was used to determine the groove profile shape and the grating relief depth. The study of the SPP excitation features was carried out on a stand mounted on the basis of a G5M goniometer and an FS-5 Fedorov stage by measuring the angular dependences of the intensity of specularly reflected and diffracted p-polarized radiation of He-Ne laser. When determining the SPP excitation efficiency, the resonance values of both specular reflection and reflection in the -1st DO were taken into account. It was found that the dependence of the integral plasmon absorption on the grating modulation depth (h/a) is described by a somewhat asymmetric curve with a wide maximum, the position of which corresponds to an h/a value of about 0.07 and a half-width of about 0.123. This allows to excite SPP with an efficiency ≥ 80% of the maximum value on the gratings with the 0,05-0,105 h/a range. The half-width of the plasmon minimum of the reflection in the -1st DO is less than in the specular reflection, which can increase sensitivity of sensor devices when registering the shift of the minimum from angular measurements. The dependence of the half-width of the SPP reflection minima on the grating modulation depth is close to quadratic. In the investigated h/a range (from 0.009 to 0.194), the maximum dynamic range of the reflection coefficient is two orders of magnitude and is achieved in specular reflection for gratings with h/a ≈ 0.075.",optoelektronìka ta napìvprovìdnikova tehnìka,"['2707-6792', '2707-6806']",journal,3,"['https://openalex.org/W1968063242', 'https://openalex.org/W1974884021', 'https://openalex.org/W1986400329', 'https://openalex.org/W1987880468', 'https://openalex.org/W1989175596', 'https://openalex.org/W2000834326', 'https://openalex.org/W2033205443', 'https://openalex.org/W2076562645', 'https://openalex.org/W2081580549', 'https://openalex.org/W2110358914', 'https://openalex.org/W2117573075', 'https://openalex.org/W2119824952', 'https://openalex.org/W2121382040', 'https://openalex.org/W2123751154', 'https://openalex.org/W2127159287', 'https://openalex.org/W2142269155', 'https://openalex.org/W2216404643', 'https://openalex.org/W2559079242', 'https://openalex.org/W2742689927', 'https://openalex.org/W4236965194', 'https://openalex.org/W4296862']",Индутный,,False,

Пленки платины исследовались непосредственно после их получения на установке магнетронного напыления, а также после отжига в муфельной печи в воздушной атмосфере. Отжиг позволял установить возможные диапазоны изменения фрактальной размерности и высотных параметров, соответствующие деградации нанорельефа. Получены значения фрактальной размерности для пленок разной толщины при двух альтернативных методах исследования на разных исходных масштабах образцов: на основе данных атомносилового микроскопа - D̅=2,17÷2,38 и сканирующего туннельного микроскопа - D̅=2,28÷2,50 в зависимости от последовательности напыления слоев и отжига пленок. Выбор последовательности операций магнетронного напыления и отжига и внешних условий позволяют формулировать рекомендации по развитию технологии «выращивания» структур с заданной морфологией поверхности. The morphology of the relief of nanosized platinum films on the mica surface is investigated using the scanning probe (in the atomic force mode) and tunneling microscopy. Platinum films were investigated immediately after their preparation in a magnetron sputtering facility, as well as after annealing in a muffle furnace in an air atmosphere. Annealing made it possible to establish the possible ranges of variation of the fractal dimension and the altitude parameters corresponding to degradation of the nanorelief. The values of the fractal dimension were obtained for films of different thicknesses using two alternative methods of investigation at different initial scales of samples: based on the data of an atomic force microscope - D̅ = 2,17÷2,38 and a scanning tunneling microscope - D̅ = 2,28÷2,50 depending on the sequence of deposition of layers and annealing of films. For comparison, experimental data of other authors are presented. The choice of the sequence of operations for magnetron sputtering and annealing, and external conditions makes it possible to formulate recommendations for development of the technology for «growing» structures with a given surface morphology.",physical and chemical aspects of the study of clusters nanostructures and nanomaterials,"['2226-4442', '2658-4360']",journal,2,"['https://openalex.org/W2018513321', 'https://openalex.org/W2048624758', 'https://openalex.org/W2051439270', 'https://openalex.org/W2320847574', 'https://openalex.org/W2489203408', 'https://openalex.org/W2909442994', 'https://openalex.org/W3110905080', 'https://openalex.org/W4256479984']",Иванов,,False,

The high concentration of molecular imprints in their single layer points to a close packing of the deposited amino acid molecules prior to “thermal fusion”.

Charbonnier, M. Romand, U. Kogelschatz, Hilmar Esrom, R. Seeböck",Plating (geology),"Electroless plating of non-conducting materials requires a catalytic activation of the sample surface prior to the metal deposition itself. In the present work, two routes are described and compared through the use of polyimide substrates. The former involves the chemical reduction of a thin palladium acetate (PdAc) deposit and thereby the formation of metallic palladium (Pd) nuclei on a substrate, using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). The latter involves the surface grafting in air or NH3 atmosphere of oxygenated and/or nitrogenated functionalities using an excimer vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) lamp (Xe2* source delivering a VUV radiation centered at 172 nm) based on the DBD configuration. After this treatment, the surface is activated through the chemisorption of palladium from acidic SnCl2 and PdCl2 solutions, or from a simple acidic PdCl2 solution. In the first case, surface processing is performed at atmospheric pressure in air. In the second case, it is accomplished either in air or ammonia at reduced pressure. For a comparison purpose, some experiments were also carried out using plasma treatments in O2 and NH3 atmospheres at reduced pressure. In these experiments, polyimide substrates (Kapton® 500 HN and 200 MT samples) were subjected to surface activation and subsequently to electroless metallization (auto-catalytic deposition of copper or nickel). Surface analyses were carried out using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after each step of the processing in order to investigate the influence of the experimental parameters on the surface atomic concentration of the elements of interest (C, O, N, Pd …). A few investigations were also performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that surface treatments using DBD and excimer lamp resulted in quite different morphological and chemical modifications. DBD treatments induced a strong roughness and quasi-disappearance of nitrogen in the surface layer, while VUV treatments were much less aggressive. In addition, it is shown that DBD can be used to chemically reduce the Pd2+ ions deposited by spin-coating. Lastly, the significant role played by the surface grafting of nitrogenated species on adhesion of the electrolessly-deposited Ni or Cu coatings is emphasized, irrespective of the way used to perform the surface activation (immersion of the PI surfaces in acidic SnCl2 and PdCl2 solutions or in a simple PdCl2 solution to deposit PdAc films).",crc press ebooks,,ebook platform,1,[],Charbonnier,,False,

M. Fedosyuk,Homogenization,". Nanostructured NiFe films were synthesized by pulsed electrolytic deposition on silicon with a gold sublayer, after which they have been subjected to to temperature treatment at 373-673 K in order to study the effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the objects under study. High-resolution atomic force microscopy has made it possible to trace the stages of microstructure evolution under the influence of heat treatment, including the process of nonlinear increase in grain growth and two-stage agglomeration. It is shown that with an increase in heat treatment temperature to 673 K, the grain size increases from 68 to 580 nm in comparison with the initial sample, undergoing agglomeration processes at temperatures of 100 and 300 °C. The mechanical properties of nanostructured NiFe films have been studied by the nanoindentation method. The dependences of the hardness of Young’s modulus and the values of the resistance to elastoplastic deformation on depth have been obtained and analyzed in the paper. This approach has permitted to reveal differences in the behavior of the mechanical properties of the surface layer and the internal volume of the film under the action of different heat treatment temperatures, as well as to demonstrate the opposite reaction of different material layers to an increase in temperature. As a result of a thorough analysis of the deformation curves of nanoindentation, it has been found that the homogenization of the surface in combination with the activation of oxidation processes leads to the strengthening of near-surface layer of NiFe films. At the same time, the internal volume of the material is characterized by a nonlinear decrease in hardness and Young’s modulus with an increase in the heat treatment temperature. The explanation for this phenomenon has been found in the complex effect of a decrease in the number of grain boundaries (due to an increase in the average grain size with increasing temperature) and an increase in the concentration of gold atoms diffusing from the sublayer more actively with an increase in the processing temperature of NiFe films.",science & technique,"['2227-1031', '2414-0392']",journal,1,"['https://openalex.org/W1263231231', 'https://openalex.org/W1810517638', 'https://openalex.org/W1965491827', 'https://openalex.org/W1969931439', 'https://openalex.org/W1986505968', 'https://openalex.org/W1988913251', 'https://openalex.org/W1998386536', 'https://openalex.org/W2020508197', 'https://openalex.org/W2046030042', 'https://openalex.org/W2051166244', 'https://openalex.org/W2057339115', 'https://openalex.org/W2082161266', 'https://openalex.org/W2144903822', 'https://openalex.org/W2192957538', 'https://openalex.org/W2513861619', 'https://openalex.org/W2623099319', 'https://openalex.org/W2747442645', 'https://openalex.org/W2888605717', 'https://openalex.org/W2916229200', 'https://openalex.org/W2945989226', 'https://openalex.org/W3014798372']",Fedosyuk,,False,

Metallic thin films are the essence of such modern SAW filter technology. However, SAW filters realized using NiCr/Al thin films are limited to power levels of ~5 dBm at RF frequencies. This limitation on power level is due to the acousto-migration phenomenon in thin films at higher power levels. In order to enhance the power durability of SAW filters, the preferred oriented growth of Al along (111) crystallographic direction is one of the methods to reduce acousto-migration. This paper explores the growth and characterization of different metallization schemes (NiCr/Al &amp; Ti/Al) on different piezoelectric wafers to achieve oriented Al (111) film growth.

Corrosion contributes to approximately 50% of oil and refinery equipment failures. These major risks require sophisticated methods to improve oil equipment performance. LC promotes the generation of superior properties on the substrate surface, which improves service life. To reduce corrosion failure and enhance life cycles, we conducted electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of Ti and Ni powders and directly coated them on A283 steel alloy, which was alloyed by ND-YAG LC and the remelted surface of A283 steel alloy. The microstructure, element distribution and phase analysis of the cladding sample were studied by optical microscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction methods. The results indicated that the coatings with fine metallurgical bonding to the substrate comprised major stable FeTi and FeNi and illustrated two different regions of solidification microstructures. The LC process and powder feeding by EPD were applied, which improved the mechanical properties, corrosion behaviour, phase transformation and structural optimisation of the surface microstructure of the laser mixed zone. Melting of the coated sample showed that the coating produced by laser treatment had a smooth top surface. In addition, we have a proven case of surface treatment with a laser that delivered the required performance.

Replacing the glass substrate with a polymer one has reduced the cost of ChE, led to increased sensitivity and simplification of its manufacturing technology, which does not require the use of intermediate adhesion layers. Additionally, we applied a thermal method of modifying the optical and structural properties of the substrate – hot pressing of the matrix, which contained a periodically nanostructured surface relief in the form of a diffraction two-dimensional (2D) lattice. The original 2D lattice was recorded on photoresist-covered (Shepley 1805) glass plates using the method of two-beam interference (He-Cd laser, = 440 nm) at double exposure (time 2040 s, power 20 mW/cm2) of the sample with a rotation of 90.

The layers obtained by EBE have a roughness 1.5 times higher than the layers deposited by the ALD method (R a =1 nm and R a =0.6 nm). Nanoparticles formed on the surface of the EBE layer are characterized by a large average size (about 30 nm) and a 1.3 times greater dispersion of the distribution compared to nanoparticles formed on the ALD layer. TiN layers obtained by EBE are characterized by better surface wettability in comparison with ALD layers. The contact angle for catalyst nanoparticles on the surface of the EBE layer of TiN is about 30 degrees and approaches 90 degrees for ALD layers. Catalyst spreading is due to the Wenzel model. It is shown that the higher surface roughness of the EBE samples is associated with the crystallization of TiN, since the layer formation process proceeds at a higher temperature compared to the ALD process.

Н. Коротаев, Е. В. Иванова",Deposition,"Introduction. The development of modern equipment and technologies for geological exploration and mining processes raises the problem of ensuring the reliability and durability of mechanic units operating under the conditions of elevated temperatures and pressures in the presence of aggressive external environments. In this regard, there is a need to create functional coatings with unique physical, mechanical and operational properties. Aim. To improve the performance of electrospark coatings based on an analysis of a cause-andeffect diagram and a regression study of the technological modes of processing steel units of geological exploration equipment (on the example of hydraulic cylinder rods of drilling pumps). Materials and methods. To harden the steel surfaces of hydraulic equipment parts, the technology of electrospark deposition (ESD) was used on an IMES-1001 mechanized installation using carbide electrodes and various gas media. In order to identify causal relationships between the factors affecting the hardened surface and to establish the most important factors affecting the quality of the formed coating, the Ishikawa diagram method was used and a regression analysis was performed. The adhesion activity of the obtained coatings was assessed by atomic force microscopy on a Solver PRO scanning probe microscope in a semi-contact air scanning mode using NSG10probe sensors with a resonance frequency of 219 kHz and a radius of curvature of the probe tip of 10 nm. When determining the strength of the adhesive interaction of the probe and the surface at one point, the absolute error was 15 nN. Tribological tests were carried out on a 2070-СМТ-1 standard friction machine according to the “disk-shoe” scheme. Results. The obtained cause-and-effect diagram showed that the technological modes of an electrospark deposition installation comprise a determining factor affecting the quality of the formed layers and coatings. In order to identify those process parameters that had the greatest effect, a regression analysis was carried out. The capacitance of the unit capacitors was found to have the greatest impact on the adhesion force formed by the ESD coating. Therefore, in order to reduce the strength of the adhesive interaction of surfaces and, as a result, increase their wear resistance, it is necessary to increase the capacitance of capacitors while reducing the voltage and processing time when implementing the ESD technology. On the basis of tribological tests, it is concluded that the minimum wear rate of coatings can be obtained by alloying the steel surface in an oxygen environment with a carbide electrode based on tungsten carbide with additives of elements that form unlimited solid solutions with the surface material and perform the role of fluxes (Ni-Cr-B-Si). Conclusion. Due to strict requirements to the performance of metal surfaces of units that enter into frictional interaction during the implementation of mining and exploration processes, there is a need to improve existing technologies for creating functional (wear-resistant) coatings.",proceedings of higher educational establishments geology and exploration,"['0016-7762', '2618-8708']",journal,1,"['https://openalex.org/W2062602538', 'https://openalex.org/W2616158904', 'https://openalex.org/W2883060495', 'https://openalex.org/W2972492012', 'https://openalex.org/W3000446484', 'https://openalex.org/W3187991196']",Коротаев,,False,

The deposition of GaP was carried out by the method of plasma enhanced atomic-layer deposition using in situ treatment in argon plasma. It was shown that at the initial stage of the growth of GaP layers on precisely oriented (100) Si substrates and with misorientation, two-dimensional growth occurs both after chemical and plasma surface treatment. Upon growth on (111) substrates, after plasma treatment of the surface, a transition to three-dimensional growth is observed, at which the size of islands reaches 30–40 nm. The smallest root-mean-square roughness of the surface of the growing GaP layers (&lt;0.1 nm) was achieved for (100) substrates with a misorientation of 4 °. The GaP layers grown on (100) substrates had a roughness of ~ 0.1 nm, and on substrates with the (111) orientation - 0.12 nm. It was found that the surface treatment of Si substrates with the (100) orientation in hydrogen plasma leads to a slight increase in the surface roughness of growing GaP layers (0.12–0.14 nm), which is associated with the effect of inhomogeneous etching of silicon in hydrogen plasma. When treating the (100) silicon surface in argon plasma, the surface roughness does not change significantly in comparison with the chemical surface treatment. On the surface of substrates with preliminary deposition of an epitaxial Si layer with a thickness of 4 nm, the morphology of GaP layers is the same as in the case of using hydrogen plasma.",физика и техника полупроводников,"['0015-3222', '1726-7315']",journal,0,[],Uvarov,,False,

A 100 nm thick ZnO layer was prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Organic CH 3 -PTTP-CH 3 films and BPDA films up to 8 nm thick were formed by thermal vacuum deposition. During film deposition, the electronic characteristics of the surface were studied using total current spectroscopy (TCS) in the energy range from 5 eV to 20 eV above EF. In this energy range, the structure of the maxima of the unoccupied electronic states of CH 3 -PTTP-CH 3 and BPDA films was determined. As a result of the CH 3 -PTTP-CH 3 film deposition, a decrease in the work function to 4.0 eV was found, compared with the value of the work function of 4.2 eV measured from the ALD ZnO-substrate. This corresponds to the transfer of a negative charge from the CH 3 -PTTP-CH 3 film to the substrate. The charge transfer at the interface between the BPDA film and the ALD ZnO-substrate occurs in the opposite direction, since a 4.7 eV increase of the work function was registered during the formation of this interface.

Dr Zeimpekis and the team have demonstrated a method that combines ALD and multistage annealing to decouple the control of film characteristics.

In addition to carrying out elemental analyses of the various feed and product fractions, characterization was undertaken using H{sup 1} and C{sup 13} NMR. Initially commercial were evaluated. Second these commercial catalysts were promoted with precious metals using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Performance improvements were observed that declined with catalyst aging. An alternate approach was undertaken to deeply upgrade ULI product oils. Using a synthesized catalyst, much lower hydrogenation temperatures were required than commercial catalysts. Other performance improvements were also observed. The resulting lube oil fractions were of high purity even at low reaction severity. The products recovered from both the ALD and other processes were water-white (even those from the low temperature, low residence time (high space velocity), low conversion runs). These results indicate that highly upgraded recycle lube oils can be produced using ALD-deposited active metal catalysts.

The layers obtained by EBE have a roughness 1.5 times higher than the layers deposited by the ALD method (Ra = 1 nm and Ra = 0.6 nm). Nanoparticles formed on the surface of the EBE layer are characterized by a large average size (about 30 nm) and a 1.3 times greater dispersion of the distribution compared to nanoparticles formed on the ALD layer. TiN layers obtained by EBE are characterized by better surface wettability in comparison with ALD layers. The contact angle for catalyst nanoparticles on the surface of the EBE layer of TiN is about 30 degrees and approaches 90 degrees for ALD layers. Catalyst spreading is due to the Wenzel model. It is shown that the higher surface roughness of the EBE samples is associated with the crystallization of TiN, since the layer formation process proceeds at a higher temperature compared to the ALD process.

They have specific applications in medical implants due to their biofilm resistance properties. CICNT can be grown on a variety of material substrates such as silicon, stainless steel, and pure titanium. Different substrates require different CICNT growth processes. This study developed a growth method for CICNT on Ti6Al4V, a titanium alloy commonly used as a medical implant material due to its strong mechanical properties and excellent biocompatibility. However, due to the presence of vanadium in the alloy, it is difficult to use it as a substrate for CICNT growth. To solve this problem, this study used an indirect growth method, which placed a barrier layer of alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) between the Ti6Al4V and an iron growth catalyst layer. A control group was also created without an alumina barrier layer. This study additionally investigated the differences between two deposition methods: electron-beam physical vapor deposition (PVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). After CICNT growth, the samples showed that the deposition of the barrier layer allowed the growth of CICNT on Ti6Al4V. Using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the results also showed that at the levels of alumina studied, the deposition method did not make a difference to CICNT coverage of the Ti6Al4V. These results illustrate the fact that Ti6Al4V can be used as a substrate for CICNT if a barrier layer is used.",curiosity interdisciplinary journal of research and innovation,['2692-4188'],journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1972556693', 'https://openalex.org/W1982904490', 'https://openalex.org/W1999256995', 'https://openalex.org/W2030970608', 'https://openalex.org/W2069753117', 'https://openalex.org/W2075380481', 'https://openalex.org/W2134259580', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701', 'https://openalex.org/W2168217941', 'https://openalex.org/W2345399582', 'https://openalex.org/W2620958503', 'https://openalex.org/W2763939118', 'https://openalex.org/W2779000621', 'https://openalex.org/W2796849809', 'https://openalex.org/W2985862477', 'https://openalex.org/W3210089778']",Arias,,False,

On the other hand, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to enable >20% efficient cells with SnOx deposited after the perovskite on top of buffer layers. Thus, perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells utilizing SnOx have been limited to the use of ALD. To provide an alternative to ALD, we investigate the potential for a novel aerosol-based tool to deposit SnOx, at room temperature, on top of the perovskite (with and without buffer layers).

For thin film, heteroepitaxial growth of a crystalline film on a different crystalline substrate is usual, and the lattice mismatch between the crystalline film and the substrate occurring in heteroepitaxy produces many misfits at the interface, which create various defects, including dislocations and grain boundaries that eventually lead to a rough surface and the deterioration of the overall quality of the crystal.

Growth of aluminum-oxide layers from anodization of metallic aluminum films is greatly advantageous when compared to sophisticated processes such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) or deposition methods that demand relatively high temperatures (above 300 °C) such as aqueous combustion or spray-pyrolysis. However, the electrical properties of the transistors are highly dependent on the presence of defects and localized states at the semiconductor/dielectric interface, which are strongly affected by the manufacturing parameters of the anodized dielectric layer. To determine how several fabrication parameters influence the device performance without performing all possible combination of factors, we used a reduced factorial analysis based on a Plackett-Burman design of experiments (DOE). The choice of this DOE permits the use of only 12 experimental runs of combinations of factors (instead of all 256 possibilities) to obtain the optimized device performance.

One method to address the demands of the next-generation of devices is atomic layer etching (ALE) which provides high fidelity, selectivity, and directionality, and layer-by-layer removal. Plasma-assisted ALE has been extensively studied for a variety of materials, including Al2O3, HfO2, Si, and Si based dielectrics. Plasma-assisted ALE of SiO2 or SiNx typically uses two sequential steps in a cyclic fashion: CFx deposition from a C4F8/Ar plasma followed by an Ar plasma activation step. However, the surface chemistry during plasma ALE is not well understood. In this study, we used in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FTIR) spectroscopy and in situ four-wavelength ellipsometry during ALE to monitor the surface reactions, film composition, as well as the net film thickness. Similar to area-selective atomic layer deposition, we show that surface functionalization prior to ALE can be used to alter the etch per cycle. Using this methodology, we will discuss how selective functionalization of SiO2 or SiNx can be used to alter the selectivity during plasma-assisted ALE.

CoO x nanoparticles are deposited on the sintered PBSCF surface using a plasma-enhanced (PE) atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, thereby avoiding any unwanted reactions or phase changes. The CoO x nanoparticles are successfully deposited uniformly onto the entire surface of the porous and complex cathode structure. A constant deposition rate is observed because of the self-limiting characteristics of the ALD process by a thickness difference as a function of a change in the cycle count. In our experiment, the performance of the fuel cells increases by approximately 36 % compared with the untreated cells at an operating temperature of 650 °C. In addition, all cells feature long-term stability. Impedance analysis reveals that the CoO x nanoparticle treatment results in a significant polarization and some ohmic loss improvement within all temperature regions.

In this energy range, the structure of the maxima of the unoccupied electronic states of CH3-PTTP-CH3 and BPDA films was determined. As a result of the CH3-PTTP-CH3 film deposition, a decrease in the work function to 4.0 eV was found, compared with the value of the work function of 4.2 eV measured from the ALD ZnO substrate.

There are different methods to produce 2D materials such as wet chemical synthesis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), molecular beam epitaxy, atomic layer deposition, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), all of which require hours during the processes. Once the 2D structures are obtained, their properties including their defects should be revealed by different characterization tools. Characterization process also requires time and expertise. In this respect, deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be a solution for the practical and rapid classification of the produced samples. However, there is not enough number of samples in most of the research laboratories because of the above-mentioned long experimental processes. This work presents the performance of a CNN algorithm using artificially created images of MoS2, a commonly studied 2D semiconductor with a high potential in different electronics applications. The synthetic optical microscopic images including normal and defected MoS2 flakes are generated by the intensities of light incident on different materials using Fresnel Equations. A deep CNN algorithm is constructed to detect the normal and defective samples. As a result of the experiments, an average of 88.9% accuracy was obtained.

When combined with suitable host medium and integrated circuit design, rare-earth doped materials can be tailored into efficient and low-noise integrated devices such as waveguide amplifiers and lasers with relatively straightforward and cheap fabrication techniques. Despite their superior properties and potential, rare-earth-doped waveguide technology still remains relatively immature when it comes to the production of competitive building blocks for the silicon photonics industry. Further improvements, such as higher gain, scalable fabrication process and lower deposition temperatures need to be pursued for ultimate cost-efficiency and silicon photonic circuit compatibility. In this work, we present a novel waveguide amplifier design that combines silicon nitride strip waveguides and multiple spatially engineered erbium-doped active layers to improve the gain characteristics of hybrid waveguide amplifiers fabricated on silicon with cost-effective and mass-scalable methods. By spatially controlling the erbium-ion distribution of the proposed multilayer waveguide amplifier such that it matches the transverse intensity distribution of the fundamental mode propagating within the device, we show up to 30% enhanced optical gain when compared to an amplifier design that utilizes only a single gain layer.

The addition of small amounts of dopants to the conventional gate insulator of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, followed by crystallization annealing, introduces intriguing new functionality that has captivated both academia and industry. The fluorite-structured ferroelectrics offer ample memory window in ferroelectric field-effect transistors, even at sub-10-nm thickness, owing to their impressively high coercive field of ~1.0 MV/cm. Moreover, their bandgap, exceeding 5 eV, enables effective scaling down with minimal leakage current. Additionally, their growth via atomic layer deposition ensures precise control over thickness, even on complex three-dimensional nanostructures. Nevertheless, certain challenges persist, demanding urgent solutions, such as limited endurance, device-to-device variation, and the need to strike a balance between operational speed and endurance.

However, the potential of ALD goes far beyond those application fields and numerous new applications that involve thin films produced by this technology are emerging. A very interesting research and development direction involves biomaterials. Herein, various individual directions can be distinguished, namely i) material development based on blends of biomaterials and inorganics, ii) development of biocompatible thin films coatings for medial implants, or iii) approaches towards controlled drug delivery. Besides the main positive characteristics of ALD that include extreme control over the coating thicknesses, thickness uniformity and conformality, one key aspect of such processing is the fact that many materials can be deposited at substantially lower temperatures than with competing technologies. This allows for processing of some thermally sensitive materials such as biomaterials or polymers, still maintaining the high quality of the final coating. As a result, functionalization of polymeric implants in a simple and cost-effective way is foreseen. Although the research in those areas is still in its infancy, the acquired knowledge about suitable processes and materials promises great new developments in near future.

However, the complexity of nanofabrication processes often introduces various sources of noise that affect metrological measurements, leading to deviations from expected performance metrics. This study presents a comprehensive modeling approach to optimize nanofabrication processes while simultaneously implementing noise reduction strategies in metrological measurements. The research integrates analytical modeling, computational simulations, and experimental validation to enhance process efficiency and measurement accuracy. The study first examines key nanofabrication techniques, including electron beam lithography (EBL), nanoimprint lithography (NIL), and atomic layer deposition (ALD), identifying the primary sources of noise inherent in these processes. These noise factors include thermal fluctuations, mechanical vibrations, and quantum effects, which contribute to measurement inaccuracies. A mathematical framework is developed to quantify these noise sources and predict their impact on measurement precision. Computational modeling, leveraging finite element analysis (FEA) and machine learning algorithms, is used to optimize process parameters and mitigate noise-induced distortions. To improve metrological accuracy, advanced noise reduction strategies such as adaptive filtering, signal averaging, and machine learning-based noise suppression techniques are implemented. Experimental validation is conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. The results demonstrate significant improvements in measurement precision, reducing error margins and enhancing reproducibility in nanofabrication processes. This research contributes to the field of nanomanufacturing by providing a systematic methodology for modeling and optimizing nanofabrication processes while minimizing noise-related metrological uncertainties. The findings have significant implications for semiconductor manufacturing, biomedical devices, and nanoscale electronics, where precise measurements are critical for device performance and reliability.",international journal of multidisciplinary research and growth evaluation,['2582-7138'],journal,0,[],Nwokediegwu,,False,

Parashar,"Passivation, Black silicon, Aluminum Oxide, Aluminium oxides","Abstract This accepted manuscript was withdrawn on 2 November 2020 on the author's request. In this work, the effective surface passivation of nano-textured silicon (NT-Si) using sputtered aluminum oxide (AlOx) films has been demonstrated and established a comparison with atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown AlOx films. Silver assisted wet chemical etching (SAWCE) is used to prepare optically black NT-Si. Sub-wavelength size features of NT-Si surface optimized to control the surface defect states which act as trap centres for charge carriers and proportional to the surface area. Sputtered and ALD grown AlOx films used to passivate the NT-Si surfaces are analyzed primarily in context of available trap centres. The AlOx/NT-Si interface is quantiﬁed by the density of interface trap states (Dit) and the total fixed charge (Qf) that correlated with effective surface recombination velocity (Seff) of carriers. The estimated Dit and Qf of sputtered AlOx films are ~4 x 1011 eV-1cm-2 and ~7 x 1012 cm-2, respectively which results in the Seff of ~37 cm/s due to the field-effect passivation. While the Dit and Qf of ALD grown AlOx films are 1.1 x 1011 eV-1cm-2 and ~7.8 x 1012 cm-2 results in the Seff of ~22 cm/s owing to both the chemical and field-effect passivation.",nanotechnology,"['0957-4484', '1361-6528']",journal,0,[],Parashar,,False,

The films were deposited on two types of surface of polycrystalline Au: ex situ Au layer thermally deposited in a separate chamber, and on the in situ Au surface prepared inside the analytical chamber. The structure of the films was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The formation of a superposition of the amorphous and crystalline phases with a period of 3.8 nm is discussed. Investigations of the energy positioning of the maxima of unoccupied electronic states and of the process of the formation of the potential boundary barrier were carried out by the method of total current spectroscopy (TCS). The maxima of the fine structure of the total current spectra (FSTCS) of the CH3-PTTP-CH3 film 5–7 nm thick did not differ when using different types of Au substrates and the surface of the ZnO semiconductor prepared by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. When the CH3-PTTP-CH3 layer was deposited both on the ex situ Au surface and on the in situ Au surface, a slight (about 0.1 eV) increase in the electronic work function was observed with an increase in the coating thickness to 5–7 nm. At such CH3-PTTP-CH3 film thicknesses, the electron work function was determined as 4.7 ± 0.1 eV for the ex situ Au substrate and 4.9 ± 0.1 eV for the in situ Au substrate.

This study investigates the crystal structure of thin films of chalcogenides, particularly a junction with a p-type (Cu2S) and an n-type (CdS) layer deposited one on top of the other on a Ag(111) substrate, starting from an aqueous solution and by means of electrochemical atomic layer deposition (E-ALD) (the system is denoted by (Cu2S)60/(CdS)60/Ag(111)). The experiment highlights the profound epitaxial relationship existing between the films and the bulk, consequent to the homogenization of the metrics of the CdS and the Cu2S structures to values commensurate to the surface periodicity of the substrate. Cadmium sulfide develops an elementary cell with crystallographic axes parallel to those of the Ag(111) and parameters |a|, |b| and |c| not found in any of the known mineral phases. The comparison with the wurtzite-type structure of greenockite shows a compensation mechanism related to the strain imposed by the film growth on the crystallographic Ag(111) surface. The positions in the reciprocal space of the Cu2S reflection is compatible with a pseudo-hexagonal pattern rotated by 30° with respect to the Ag, as already noticed in relation to a Cu2S/Ag(111) E-ALD deposit (Giaccherini et al., 2017). The Cu2S c axis results parallel to the direction [111] of the Ag substrate and its structure is characterized by the strong occurrence of the 3.963 Å periodicity, which corresponds to the interatomic distance S-S in the triangular CuS3 groups, the basis of all the mineral Cu2-xS group structures. These data suggest a pseudo-hexagonal chalcocite-like structure with a planarization of S layers (Giaccherini et al., 2017) as a result of the strong epitaxial relationship existing with the CdS below.

We showed how oxygen partial pressure and gas impurities impact the stability of SOFC cathodes. We developed atomic layer deposition (ALD) coating techniques for electrodes and showed that by introducing different elements and different ALD oxidizers, electrode surface chemistry can be altered, resulting in enhanced oxygen reduction kinetics. In addition, we developed solution infiltration technique to enhance performance and durability of electrodes. Different infiltrates as well as different thermal treatment processes were screened to identify the optimal surface modification process that yields both low impedance and high durability. The modified cathode shows excellent stability and has a low area specific resistance (ASR) of only 0.2 Ωcm2 at 600 °C after over 2000 hours of operation. Further, we developed ceramic anodes, SrFe(Co,Mo)O3 (SFCM) and SrFe(Ni,Mo)O3(SFNM), and enhanced anode oxidation kinetics by solution infiltration or in situ catalyst exsolution from the ceramic anode surface. The modified anodes showed improved performance in full SOFCs, and the optimized anode modification shows high stability for over 400 hours at 550 °C. Moreover, the modified anode also demonstrates high durability in methane.

The market share of bifacial silicon modules is rising. To compete with silicon photovoltaics, perovskite solar cells also need to go bifacial structure for an increased energy yield. In addition, the bifacial perovskite modules are essentially semitransparent modules which are needed to realize efficient perovskite-silicon 4-terminal tandem modules. However, the efficiency of bifacial perovskite modules was far below that of monofacial ones. Here I will report bifacial perovskite minimodules with a high certified efficiency by addressing several unique challenges in bifacial module design and fabrication. The front efficiency without albedo light already reached that of best opaque monofacial minimodules, which is the highest efficiency a bifacial module can reach, while these bifacial modules gain additional power from albedo light. The additional of hydrophobic additive in hole transport layer surprisingly protects the perovskite films from moisture damage during atomic layer deposition. Integrating silica nanoparticles with proper size and spacing in perovskite films recovers the absorption loss induced by the absence of reflective metal electrodes while maintains the charge collection properties of perovskites. The small area single junction bifacial cells have an equivalent stabilized efficiency of 26.4% at an albedo of 0.2, which is already higher than any reported single junction perovskite solar cells. The bifacial solar minimodules show front and rear aperture efficiencies of 19.2% and 14.1%, respectively, certified by National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which yield an equivalent aperture efficiency of 22% at albedo of 0.2. We also show that the bifacial minimodules are extremely stable, with 97% of its initial efficiency retained after light soaking under one simulated sun for over 6000 hours at 60±5 °C, representing the most stable perovskite module reported so far. We believe these efficiency and stability of the perovskite modules represent a significant advance, while most other reported work still focus on small area devices.",,,,0,[],Gu,,False,

CNTs can be synthetized by several methods, such as arc-discharge, chemical vapor deposition, laser ablation and electrolysis. All these methods lead to CNTs with different diameters, lengths and numbers of layers, but these methods require high costs of production, high temperatures and high pressures, and most of them require repeated procedures for their purification after obtaining. As an alternative to a avoid these disadvantages, chemical techniques seem to be a good option to obtain CNTs easily (at low temperatures and without applying pressure) and inexpensively [1].Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) were prepared by chemical synthesis using graphite microparticles, concentrated sulfuric acid, fuming nitric acid and potassium chlorate. The synthesis parameters were fixed based on previous work [2]. In order to improve the solubility of the MWCNTs in organic solutions, acid treatment was used (H2SO4 (95%) and HNO3 (65%) in a ratio of 3:1) by functionalizing the surfaces of CNTs with negatively charged functional groups (MWCNTs-COOH). The obtained materials were investigated by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).The research focused on analyzing both the MWCNTs obtained by this new method and the functionalized MWCNTs. The major functional groups of the MWCNTs and functionalized MWCNTs were identified by FTIR analysis (Figure 1). Moreover, in order to estimate the functionalization, the same quantity of MWCNTs was dispersed in water, before and after functionalization, for 2 h in an ultrasonic bath and afterwords visually observed to evaluate their suspension stability (Figure 2).By using this chemical route, pure MWCNTs were synthetized (sustained by FTIR and EDAX), with a diameter between 9 nm and 43 nm and 500–600 nm in length, as proven by TEM and AFM analysis. The functionalization of these MWCNTs was also successfully done, which was confirmed by FTIR and aqueous dispersion of the nanotubes.

The electrical parameters are determined from the Y-MOSFET drain-gate characteristics ( Ids - Vg ) with 100 nm thick drain-stock W electrodes deposited by magnetron sputtering on the SOS mesastructures through a lithographic mask. A comparison of these characteristics with Raman scattering data shows that the mechanical compression stresses introduced by BTI irradiation in silicon correspond to the volume ratios of Xe and Bi tracks in HA ferroelectric and sapphire.",автометрия,['0320-7102'],journal,0,[],ПОПОВ,,False,

However, there are major challenges that need to be addressed to further progress in this field, particularly in terms of integration into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology [1]. Moreover, the majority of the reported ReRAM devices exhibit low resistance causing sneak current and high-power consumption in circuit applications [2]. Therefore, they require a rectifier for the control of the low resistance state (LRS). In this work, we introduce a new CMOS-compatible self-rectifying bilayer W/GaOx/HfO2/Ti memristive device, where thin amorphous GaOx (5 nm) and HfO2 (4 nm) layers are deposited by atomic layer deposition at low temperature (250 °C). The I-V characteristics of the devices exhibit a hysteretic behavior with access to low resistance and high resistance states with an operating voltage of 3.3 V. Both the HRS and LRS values scale with the electrode area, suggesting a bulk/interfacial-governed switching mechanism. The amorphous GaOx layer provides rectification (no need for a compliance current) due to its semiconducting nature that can be tuned with the deposition parameters [3]. A potentiation depression behavior is evidenced under an identical pulse scheme programming with a low operation voltage (Vwrite = 3.2 V). In this voltage range, good compatibility with CMOS devices is achieved. Low writing (~ 260 nA/µm²) and reading currents (~100- 600 pA/µm²) can enable low power applications. Moreover, the current levels can be tailored to the needs of a specific circuit by simply changing the electrode area. We exploit the analog behavior of this new bilayer GaOx/HfO2 memristive device to detect high frequency activity of neuronal cell culture. The device response under pre-recorded neuronal signals (spike trains) is studied and shows a potential for integration in the back-end-of-line of hybrid CMOS/microelectrode array (MEA) chips for real-time neuronal activity processing.

Francis, Roselien Vercauteren, Audrey Leprince, Jacques Mahillon",Porous Silicon,"The rapid detection of hazardous bacteria is important for healthcare situations, where such identification can lead to substantial gains for patient treatment and recovery and a reduced usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Potential biosensors must be able to provide a fast, sensitive and selective response with as little sample preparation as possible. Indeed, some of these pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, can be yet harmful at very low concentrations in the blood stream, e.g., below 10 colony forming units per mL (CFU/mL). These stringent requirements limit the number of candidates, especially for point-of-care applications. Amongst several biosensing techniques, optical sensing using porous silicon (PSi) substrate has been widely suggested in recent years thanks to unique features such as a large surface area, tunable optical characteristics, and above all relatively easy and affordable fabrication techniques. In most configurations, PSi optical biosensors are close-ended porous layers; this limits their sensitivity and responsiveness due to diffusion-limited infiltration of the analytes in the porous layer. Also, PSi is a reactive material, its oxidation in buffer solutions results in time-varying shifts. Despite its attractive properties, several challenges must still be overcome in order to reach practical applications. Our work addresses three main improvement points. The first one is the stability over time in saline solutions helped by atomic layer deposition of metal oxides inside the pores. Besides a better stability, our solution is helping with an increase of the optical signal to noise ratio, thus reducing the limit of detection. The second one is to perform the lysis of the bacteria prior to its exposure to the sensor, such that the selective detection is based upon the percolation of bacterial residues inside the pores rather than the bacteria themselves. The third one is to remove the bulk silicon below a PSi layer to create a membrane, that allows for flow-through of the analytes, thus enhancing the interactions between the lysate and the sensor's surface. This approach allows us to avoid the step of surface functionalization used in classical biosensors. We tested thanks to these improvements the selective detection of Bacillus cereus lysate with concentrations between 103 and 105 CFU/mL. Future works are dedicated to further improvements, including optical signal enhancement techniques and dielectrophoretic assisted percolation in the porous silicon membrane.",,,,0,[],Francis,,False,

Moret,Deposition,"Radionuclides are often used in the field of nuclear medicine. For some deceases the use of radionuclides is the best possible care, or even the only means of diagnosis or treatment. For these medical applications high specific activity (high activity per unit of mass) is required. Commonly, medical radionuclides are man-made. They can either be produced by neutron activation, charged particle or photon activation or by means of radionuclide generator. Furthermore, hospitals prefer an ‘on demand’ supply. A radionuclide generator is ideal. Radionuclide generators can also be used to produce high specific activity. Conventional radionuclide generators work with the principle that the mother and daughter radionuclide have different electrostatic interactions with the column material. This allows for easy elution of the daughter radionuclide. However, when working with chemical identical mother-daughter radionuclide pairs (e.g. 177mLu / 177Lu) another separation principle is required. Utilising ‘hot atom’ chemical principles such a mother-daughter pairs can be separated. ‘Hot atom’ principles describe the chemical effects that occur due to nuclear interactions or due to decay. An example of these effects is bond rupture. The effective range of those principles is rather limited, requiring thin layers. A possible technique to apply these thin layers is atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is commonly used in the semi-conductor industry, but can due to its versatility also be used in the field of catalysis or pharmaceutical. The advantage of using ALD is that this gas phase deposition technique allows for thin conformal coating of complex structured materials. Furthermore, the amount of material that can be deposited can easily be adapted to need because ALD is a self-limiting process. In this thesis the usefulness of ALD in combination with radionuclide production is explored. Because of the versatility of ALD it can also be used to create target materials for charged particle activation and enrichment experiments (Chapter 2). This versatility is illustrated by three case studies, namely this production of targets for 64Cu production, the production of 177Lu by means of a radionuclide generator and the production of 99Mo using three different routes. Also described is how ALD can be used to alter the surface chemistry of high surface area materials to increase their adsorption capacity for Mo (Chapter 3). The obtained particles with an alumina coating are then tested for their adsorption capacity and compared to acid activated alumina, the current used material in 99Mo/99mTc-radionuclide generators. The adsorption capacity of the obtained particles is twice that of acid activated alumina and has a 99mTc elution efficiency of 55%. Furthermore, the coating of nano-particles for the development of with Lu coated particles (Chapter 4) for the preparation of a radionuclide generator is described. ALD allows for a deposition of up to 15w% Lu. Furthermore, the gamma dose received during neutron activation has an influence on the specific activity produced (Chapter 5). Using Cu(II)-phthalocyanine as a target it is shown that an increase in gamma dose during neutron activation results in an increase in Cu release and hence a decrease in specific activity obtained.",,,,0,[],Moret,,False,

Dasgupta, Zachary Berquist, Andrew J. Gayle",Concentrated solar power,"The development of next generation concentrated solar thermal (CST) plants requires solar receivers to reach high temperatures (> 600°C) while minimizing costs. Efficiently generating such high temperatures using a line-focusing collector and an air-stable receiver has the potential to change the current CSP paradigm because it would: (1) result in large improvements in system-level efficiency of line-focusing systems by enabling the use of high-efficiency supercritical CO2 power cycles; (2) decrease the LCOE of line-focusing systems to meet SETO 2030 goals; (3) maintain performance over the lifetime of the CSP plant by avoiding issues related to breakdown of vacuum. The use of aerogels as transparent insulating materials (TIMs) in solar thermal receivers has the potential to enable such improvements. Specifically, aerogels can be placed in front of a black (or partially selective) high-temperature absorber to allow sunlight to transmit to the absorber but block heat from escaping. These materials can improve the efficiency and simplify the complexity of thermal transport systems by enabling operation at moderate or no vacuum levels. These potential benefits have been explicitly identified by SETO as ‘high impact’. The use of mesoporous silica as a TIM has already led to large improvements in solar collection efficiency. Nevertheless, these materials inherently lose structural integrity and the ability to suppress radiation losses at high temperatures. Here, we address these challenges by leveraging 1-cycle atomic layer deposition of aluminum oxide onto a silica aerogel to form a thermally stable interfacial layer that is transparent to sunlight but broadly absorbs in the mid-infrared. This interfacial absorption results in a two-fold reduction in measured heat losses from an absorber at 700°C and solar thermal efficiency of 81% at 700°C under 60 Suns, based on measurements of heat loss and solar transmittance. Extended-duration heat treatment reveals that the multicomponent aerogel is stable at high temperatures relative to a silica aerogel. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the concept of using infrared plasmon resonances to selectively enhance the thermal absorption coefficient of TIMs in order to strongly suppress thermal radiative losses at high temperatures. We term this mechanism plasmon-enhanced greenhouse selectivity (PEGS). Unlike silica aerogels, where much of the IR absorption is lost at high temperatures, local surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in doped oxide nanoparticles overlap a significant portion of the blackbody spectrum and are maintained at high temperatures.

For low PPM level concentrations, this fact does not change, despite recent tool advances utilizing NACE compliant materials. Consequently, H2S concentrations are typically under-reported which adversely affects production and presents significant health safety and environment concerns. Historically, only sampling bottles have been coated to preserve H2S concentrations during transit to laboratories with a material that is resistant to H2S reactivity to enable more representative measurements. However, only very recent efforts have transitioned the focus toward successfully coating the interior of the tools. This paper details a state-of-the-art technology, initially developed and heavily leveraged from the semiconductor industry. The technology is adapted to coat the interior surfaces of downhole tools with a chemically resistant dielectric thin film. New developments now provide the benefit of the process being safe, able to be performed at atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions, and portable; thus, allowing the coating process to be deployed to field locations. The method involves atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology to be plumbed in directly to a downhole tool and conformally deposit a thin layer (e.g. &lt; 1 micron) of highly durable H2S-resistant sapphire to the entire interior tool surface. An automated procedure has been developed allowing the versatility to accommodate a number of unique geometries inherent of different formation tester configurations. New advances in Quartz Crystal Microbalance sensors are also realized in-situ to optimize (in real-time) the efficiency of the process and ensure uniform and conformal coverage is obtained in the fastest and safest manner. Laboratory testing on a prototype system demonstrated uniform and conformal coverage of a ~ 500 nm thick sapphire film resistant to flaking and scratching. Accelerated lifetime stress testing demonstrated high durability relative to expected tool life. Testing of coated and uncoated tools show the coating is successful at the 50ppm level H2S for up to 4 days. These results are contrasted with similar tool body samples not coated with the H2S-resistant ALD sapphire and subject to the same H2S conditions. To show the coating’s durability, subsequent experiments flowed mud-based drilling fluid through both the tool body and sample chambers, followed by thorough cleaning and successful repeating the same 50ppm H2S test. Exposure of the sapphire coated tool body and sample chambers to various concentrations of H2S demonstrated zero loss. Ultimately this technique represents a new opportunity to gather representative formation samples containing low concentrations of H2S.",spwla 62nd annual online symposium transactions,,journal,0,[],Price,,False,

Grassman, Steven A. Ringel, Tal Kasher",Transparent conducting film,"This small innovation project intended to leverage recent activity and advances in ultrawide-bandgap oxide power electronics toward the investigation of Ga2O3 as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) for use in photovoltaics (PV). Ga2O3’s theoretical advantage over incumbent TCOs is its very large bandgap of 4.8 eV, ensuring optical transparency of photons with λ ≥ 260 nm, effectively the full terrestrial solar spectrum. At the time of proposal writing, literature on Ga2O3 as a TCO/optical material was relatively sparse — what little existed was focused on for UV sensors and/or emitters, with none related to PV. As such, this project was intended to help determine the potential of Ga2O3 as a PV-oriented TCO by investigating its deposition using tools common to the PV and electronics industries — atomic layer deposition (ALD) and RF sputtering (RS), both of which are already used in PV manufacturing — and its resultant optical and electronic properties. Final project goals were to test its application to Si and III-V solar cells. Controllable film thickness and excellent uniformity was established for both methods deposition methods, with ALD providing higher precision for thinner films and RS more effective for growing thicker films. The as-deposited films were found to be amorphous in nature. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) confirmed bandgaps of at least 4.8 eV and non-parasitic absorption across both AM0 and AM1.5G spectra; a refractive index approaching the expected value of 1.8 was also observed, with some degree of tunability based on process parameters. Using this initial optical data, a transfer matrix model, which interfaces with in-house EQE and LIV models, was developed to simulate Ga2O3 optical effects on various solar cells, included potential in antireflection coatings (ARCs). Despite promising optical properties, the resultant resistivity / conductivity metrics did not meet expectations, regardless of deposition process. Although thick RS-deposited films, using both undoped and 1at% Ge (n-type) doped sintered targets — demonstrated high net carrier concentrations (via C-V), and low specific resistance Ohmic contacts were demonstrated, transmission line measurements (TLM) showed very high resistivity. Further analysis indicated high vertical film conductivity, but very low lateral conductivity. Deeper characterization revealed a relatively high density of nano/microcrystalline inclusions that were ostensibly the source of the vertical conductivity, with the amorphous matrix serving as an effective insulator (likely due to high concentrations of electronic trap states). Despite extensive work to increase film polycrystallinity — demonstrated via high temperature annealing — sufficient lateral conductivity for TCO use was not achieved. The final phase of the project shifted focus toward investigation of ALD-deposited Ga2O3’s potential as a passivant and/or passivating contact for both Si and III-V solar cells, with expectation of performance similar to Al2O3. However, initial rounds of testing using our baseline ALD process yielded minimal (but not quite zero) passivation of both GaInP and Si surfaces. Dielectric passivation is well-known to be highly process sensitive; given the unoptimized nature of the process used, this work was deemed inconclusive. The final outlook with respect to feasibility of Ga2O3 as a PV-oriented TCO is, ultimately, still uncertain. The work performed in this project confirmed the optical properties and deposition methods, but the achieved electrical properties do not meet technological needs; literature reports in recent years are somewhat inconsistent and potentially untrustworthy, but generally appear to be in line with our results. At the very least it is clear that, should Ga2O3 still be under consideration for PV TCO and/or selective contact applications, a significant amount of optimization and study is still needed.",,,,0,[],Grassman,,False,

Stanis, Patrick Littlewood, Sekar Darujati, Howard S. Meyer",Carbon dioxide reforming,"The objective of this project was to develop a novel catalytic reactor containing nano-engineered catalysts for the utilization of CO2 (captured from coal-fired power plants and other CO2 emitting sources) in dry methane reforming (DMR) (CO2 + CH4 → 2 H2 + 2 CO) to produce synthesis gas (syngas). The technology aims to reduce CO2 emissions by developing beneficial uses for CO2 from coal-fired power plants. It also offers an alternative to mitigate CO2 emissions in areas where geologic storage may not be an optimal solution and/or utilization could significantly offset the costs of carbon capture and sequestration. The nano-engineered Ni-based catalyst was prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The Ni particles were as small as ~2-4 nm. The nano-engineered catalyst showed CH4 conversion >95%, H2/CO ratio in the range of 0.7-1.0, and CH4 reforming rate as high as 2,500 L/h/gNi at 850 ºC and pressure of 15-25 psia. The Ni-based ALD catalyst also showed good stability in DMR reaction during a 200-h continuous operation at 850 °C. This is due to strong bonding between the nanoparticles and substrates since the Ni nanoparticles were chemically bonded to the substrate during the ALD process. The high thermal stability maintains the high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles, which can inhibit coke formation because their step edges are small enough to limit carbon nucleation and growth. Technoeconomic analysis (TEA) indicates the levelized cost of syngas (LCOS) is $172/ton with our technology, which is lower than the equivalent (molar) cost of hydrogen produced by steam methane reforming (SMR) or autothermal reforming (ATR). The major operating cost is natural gas feed and fuel, and the levelized cost is highly sensitive to the price of natural gas and relatively insensitive to the CAPEX. Revenues from syngas could have a significant impact on the net cost of electricity (COE), depending on the cost of natural gas and the selling price of syngas, estimated at $36 per MWh if the syngas were sold at $195 per ton. Following DOE NETL’s guidance, a lifecycle analysis (LCA) was conducted to compare with SMR. The functional unit for the basis of comparison was defined as 1kg carbon monoxide in the product stream. The global warming potential (GWP) of our process was found to be 40% lower than the state-of-the-art SMR process. The sensitivity analysis confirms the emissions are most sensitive to the natural gas fuel requirements to deliver heat to the process.",,,,0,[],Liang,,False,

Compared to most light mills working at tens of Pascals [3,4], the functionality at pressures three orders-of-magnitude larger results from the metamaterial vanes' unique features: (1) extremely low areal density (0.1 mg/cm2) that reduces the vane mass and hub friction force by almost 100 times; (2) high thermal resistivity that increases the cross-vane temperature difference; and (3) micro-channels that enable through-vane thermal transpiration gas flows. Each nanocardboard vane features a basketweave-style five-flow-channel pattern to amplify the thermal transpiration force. We manufactured these vanes using microfabrication techniques in four stages: (1) silicon mold creation using photolithography and reactive ion etching; (2) mold conformal coating using atomic layer deposition; (3) carbon nanotube drop-casting and oxygen plasma etching; and (4) mold cleaving and removing using XeF2 isotropic etching [1, 5]. We 3D-printed a 26-mm-diameter quad-arm hub and mounted the vanes to it using super glue. We measured the temperature and rotation speed of the radiometer using thermal and video cameras while illuminating it using an octagonal LED array. We found that our radiometer could operate at atmospheric pressure, and that its rotation rate increased with light intensity. To our knowledge, no other radiometers have achieved such functioning in ambient air. Lastly, we simulated the radiometer's fluid dynamics, obtaining similar trends between its rotation speed and light intensity and achieving order-of-magnitude agreement with our experiments. Our photophoretically-propelled microstructures reveal new possibilities for light sensing and actuation, aerial microflyers, and photo-generators. References: [1] Lin, Chen, et al.

They are also important components of high energy density (HED) and inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets. However, despite tremendous progress that has been made in the synthesis of porous materials, deterministic and independent control over microscopic architecture, density and composition remain key issues, and their integration in high precision devices requires cost and time-intensive mechanical machining that not only reduces reproducibility by generating debris but also limits the complexity of the 3D shapes that can be realized. In this project, we overcame these limitations by developing a universal templating capability that provides deterministic and independent control over density, composition, architecture, and macroscopic sample shape. This was achieved by developing the technology to 1) 3D print ultrahigh resolution, ultra-high precision polymeric micro-lattice templates, 2) coat these templates with the desired materials, and 3) removing the template (Fig. 1a). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) provides the atomic scale coating thickness accuracy required for precisely controlling density. While this templating approach had been demonstrated in prior work, limitations in suitable photoresists, 3D print technologies, print design, and template removal techniques did not allow the fabrication of millimeter-sized high-precision parts with sub-micron resolution. To enable this technology, we developed 1) two-photon polymerization (TPP) print designs that enable the fabrication of millimeter-sized, mechanically robust polymeric templates with sub-micron resolution and 2) a continuum level TPP printing simulation capability for additional print design guidance; 3) atomistic models to study photoresist polymerization kinetics and network topography, 4) refractive index matched polymeric and preceramic TPP photoresists, and 5) functional TPP photoresists including porous voxel structures and self-immolative polymer photoresist chemistries; and 6) damage free template removal techniques that enable the fabrication of defect-free high-precision low-density foam components. We also developed a templating approach for pure carbon microlattices with a unique tube-in-tube ligament morphology. As a test platform, we pursued the fabrication of foam liners that promise to further increase the neutron yield in indirect drive ICF experiments by improving implosion symmetry control and coupling between the laser and the deuterium-tritium fuel. This application requires fabrication and integration of a ultra-high precision, millimeter-sized, thin-walled (200-400 micrometer thick), low-density (10-30 mg/cc), high atomic number (high Z) cylindrical foam tube into the gold hohlraum of an indirect drive ICF target (Fig. 1b). While our hohlraum liner test case will mainly find application in HED and ICF experiments, the underlying science will also directly apply to previously developed nanoparticle and additive manufacturing technologies and will advance those techniques as well.",,,,0,[],Biener,,False,

The material systems being investigated are commercial composite electrodes complex three-dimensional topographies. In term of the chemistry of the ALD layer applied on the internal surface of the porous cathode, this project has employed commercially relevant electrolyte, electrocatalyst and noble metal materials set. Such materials are fully compatible with the commercial fuel cells, and this project has developed special nanostructure on the surface of the commercial composite cathodes. The formation of the designed nanoarchitecture on the surface of SOFC cathode has been achieved through precise control of ALD parameters and their effect on overall cell performance and resultant electrochemical reaction mechanism of cathodes has been investigated through full cell electrochemical performance testing and nanostructure characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Under the support of this award, following has been achieved: (1). For cathode materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), such as perovskite mixed conductor La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x (LSCF), cation surface segregation and consequently losing conductivity and active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are problematic. To mitigate the cation segregation and enhance SOFC durability, further decorating the internal backbone surface using the desired electrocatalysts could be a promoting approach. Commonly, the cation segregation such as Sr is very volatile, so the effective surface decoration is ideally conformal. Nevertheless, the conformal surface coating would inevitably alter the ORR pathways that initially take place on the surface of the backbone. To reveal the impact of the conformal coating on both the catalytic activity and the conductivity of the cathode, the unary electrocatalyst of Pt or CoOx, was applied to the LSCF/SDC composite electrode of inherently functional SOFCs, respectively. Both ALD coating layers evolve strong interaction with the LSCF composite cathode. Upon operations, the Pt coating layer remains conformal on LSCF grain surfaces but turns into discrete particles on SDC grain surfaces. Meanwhile, CoOx conformal coating grows to be the discrete nanograins on both the LSCF and SDC grains. ALD coating of the cathode alone reduces the ohmic resistance up to 28 % for the entire cells. The increased conductivity induced by the ALD coating of Pt or CoOx is ascribed to different mechanisms. For the inherent functional SOFCs, the present study presents a novel and feasible approach to apply a conformal, dense coating layer on the surface of a mixed conductor, simultaneously increasing the conductivity and durability of the SOFC cathode. (2). High resistance of the oxygen electrode still significantly hinders the state-of-the-art Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs). In particular, for an oxygen electrode consisting of mixed electronic and ionic conductors, such as perovskite lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF), it deteriorates due to its low chemical stability of the grain surface. Such degradation is often associated with the segregation of cations. To prevent the cation surface segregation and its resultant perovskite phase decomposition, we demonstrate a conformal ultra-thin (7-10 nm) surface heterogeneous coating layer consisting of subjacent discrete Pt nanoparticles capped with a superjacent fully dense conformal CoOx layer. The performance studies indicate the ALD coating reduces the cell series resistance by up to 40 %. The conformal CoOx layer consists of randomly orientated but single-layered nanograins, with high-density intergranular and surface grain boundaries serving as the electrochemical reaction sites and facilitating mass transport. The conformal coating layer appears to have successfully suppressed the Sr outward diffusion and confined the Sr enriched layer to a ~ 2 nm interface perovskite phase between the coating layer and the LSCF grain surface. Moreover, this ultra-thin Sr enriched perovskite layer presumably possesses high oxygen vacancy and high ionic conductivity and further imposes tensile strain to the LSCF grain surfaces. With the combination of a conformal CoOx nanoionics, Sr enriched layer, and its strained interface, the ALD coating induced surface layer is estimated to have a conductivity of ~ 1.27x104 S/cm, which is over two orders magnitude of that from LSCF at 750 ºC.",,,,0,[],Song,,False,

Such coating layer was developed using the additive manufacturing process of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and has been applied on the cathode consisting of either an electronic conductor of LaxSr1-xMnyO3-δ (LSM) or mixed ionic and electronic conducting LaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-δ (LSCF). PI's work has demonstrated that the internal surface of cathode from the commercial cells, can be further tailored using ALD coating to dramatically enhance the cell performance. For instance, ALD layer consisting heterostructured nano composite of nano-Pt and nano-(Mn0.8Co0.2)3O4 oxide on the internal surface of porous LSM/YSZ cathode from SOFCs, has resulted in the large reduction of the cell polarizations resistance by up to 53%, and enormous increase of power density over 370%. For the cells with LSCF/Sm2O3 doped CeO2 (SDC) cathode, the conformal layer of nano-composite consisting of superjacent CoOx and subjacent minimum amount of Pt nano-grains has resulted in the power density enhancement by 126% for the large scale industry tubular cells at 750°C, and both the performance enhancement and nanostructure of the ALD layer are stable over ~ 2000 h continuous operation performed at industry test station. In the meanwhile, those ALD coating layer developed by PI's work is also inherently Cr-tolerant, and could act as physical barrier for preventing Cr diffusion into the cathode backbone, so as to mitigate the Cr poisoning effect on the cathode. In this project, the impact of Cr on the performance of those ALD coated commercial cells has been evaluated. Based on evolution of the cell performance, the ALD coating layer chemistry and ALD coating layer thickness has been optimized to maximize the overall Cr tolerance, cell power density and cell longevity. Different ALD coating has been applied onto the internal surface of LSM/YSZ and LSCF/SDC backbone respectively. The architecture/scaffold structures on the internal surface of different cathode, designed by this project, was catalogued and analyzed using High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), and cell power/durability performance are assured via comprehensive electrochemical performance testing in the industry operation relevant conditions. The impact of the electrochemical operation current density, the water humidity, the cell operation temperature, and cell operation duration on the Cr tolerance of ALD coated cells has been systematically investigated. There is completely different nanostructure degradation mechanisms between LSM and LSCF cells induced by Cr contamination. For the LSCF/SDC baseline cell, With the Cr source, there is no apparent Sr surface segregation phase even for the baseline cell operated for 3000 h at 750 °C. With the Cr source, there is significant amorphous (SrCr)Ox phase accumulated in the original pore region. For the commercial baseline cells, Cr contaminants on the LSM electrode severely impacted the entire cell's electrochemical performance and nanostructure degradation. Those degradations include (1). Peak power density loss of 64 % after 109 h of operation. The dramatic increase in Rp (2). They are cracking at LSM/SSZ interface, LSM grains. SSZ remains intact but with (CrMn)Ox. By contrast, ALD coating (MnCo)Ox/Pt dramatically improves the Cr resistance, as follows (1). ALD-coated cell with a power density is 280-380 % of the baseline cell, depending on the ALD layer thickness. (2). For a cell with a 20 nm thick ALD layer, there is a large performance enhancement (> 200 % power density) induced by ALD coating of Cr-tolerant Mn0.8Co0.2Ox. (3). For a cell with a 20 nm thick ALD layer, after 168 h at 750 °C power density of the ALD-coated cell is ~ 600% of that baseline cell upon operation with Cr contamination for 109 h. The ALD coating on the internal surface of cathode developed by this project integrated multi-functions. Those multi-functions include (1). Dramatically improving the cell power density for the commercial cells; (2). Dramatically improving contamination resistance of the cathode, for being an excellent protection coating layer sealing off Cr contamination. (3). Dramatically increasing the cell longevity by potentially preventing the microstructure evolution and grain coarsening of the cathode. Overall, this project will provide a simple solution to simultaneously enhance power density and increase the reliability, robustness, and endurance of commercial SOFCs, over the entire operating temperature range of 650-800 °C. For the inherently functional SOFC, the ALD coating of LSM based cathode mitigate the Cr-contamination. Power density of ALD-coated cell is ~ 600% of that baseline cell upon operation with Cr contamination.

The surface architecture/scaffold added onto the internal surface of the anode possesses an engineered nanostructure but it features only commonly-used oxide conductors and electro-catalyst materials. The surface layer possesses a minimum thickness of ~2-40 nm and is solely designed to control the surface reforming reactions and to increase catalytic activity. Three-dimensional (3D) nano scaffold architectures with the noble metal nano-catalyst, low-cost bimetallic catalytic alloys, and nano-scale ionic conducting oxide fully compatible with the state-of-the-art Ni/YSZ anode, were applied to the internal surface of the entire porous SOFC anode using ALD. In the present work, the surface scaffold architecture is essentially multi-functional at the nano-scale, facilitated by the multiple heterostructured interfaces. It will significantly enhance the power density and cell durability for direct hydrocarbon utilization by (1) increasing the number of electrochemical reaction sites to enhance the hydrogen/hydrocarbon oxidation reactions; (2) reducing carbon formation; (3) mitigating the coarsening of backbone Ni phase and the oxidation attack of Ni from oxidants (e.g., H2O, CO2); and (4) promoting the internal reforming capabilities, especially for natural gas applications. ALD is employed to generate stable anode surface architectures that are uniform, precisely controllable at the atomic scale, and accurately repeatable for processing. The engineered anode surface nano-scaffold architecture was cataloged and analyzed using High-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and cell power/durability performance assessed via comprehensive electrochemical performance testing with commercial specimens and relevant environments using hydrocarbon fuels. To the best of our knowledge, this project is the First Report on ALD of Ni/YSZ. The actual achievement of this Project includes (1). Successful demonstration of 7 types of ALD layers on Ni/YSZ anode, including Co, Ni, Mn, Pt, Ru, ZrOx and multi-functional nano-composite. (1). Conformal coating and subsequently spontaneously pinning the discrete nano-catalyst, including the precious metal nano-catalyst and the Ni and Co catalysts, on the YSZ surface upon the electrochemical operation in the reduced atmosphere. Those nano-catalysts on the ionic-conducting YSZ provided excellent sites for promoting internal reforming; (2). Demonstrated ALD coating increased both catalytic activity and conductivity of Ni/YSZ. Conformal coating provided dopants and introduced additional electrical conducting pathways on the YSZ ionic conductor. The doped surface layer of YSZ with mixed conductivity thus further introduces the active triple phase boundaries adjacent to the ALD-coated nano-catalysts such as Pt, Co, and Ni that are pinned on the YSZ surface. The nano-composite ALD coating on Ni/YSZ anode has significantly increased cell durability; and (3). ALD coating of Ni/YSZ anode increased the power density of the entire cell by 300%. For a long time, the SOFC performance, such as the power density, was deemed hindered by the cathode. The sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode was deemed as hindering the power density of the SOFCs. For the anode-supported commercial SOFCs, the cell performance is considered to be limited by the cathode's performance. For the first time in the field of SOFC, this project has demonstrated that (1). the performance of commercial SOFCs can be further increased by the ALD coating on Ni/YSZ anode backbone. (2). ALD coating on Ni/YSZ fuel electrodes results in the enhancement of power density, and increased reliability, robustness, and endurance of SOFCs, for their application using both hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels over the entire operating temperature range of 650-800ºC for the inherently functional commercial cells. (3). ALD coating provides alternative approaches of exsolutions for introducing the stable catalyst onto the internal surface of the Ni/YSZ electrode. ALD coating could be much more versatile than exsolution in employing the catalysts with various chemistries onto the various backbones. (4). Due to the negligible amount of ALD materials coated onto the internal surface of the porous cathode of the as-fabricated cells, a peak power density increase up to 300 % induced by ALD coating was simultaneously achieved in terms of both power density and specific power.

It will revolutionize our ability to render the formation of a nanostructured electrode that has been constantly pursued yet barely achieved for practical SOFC/SOEC applications.

Additionally, the leakage of noxious lead limits the application of PSCs. Here, we develop a strategy for molecular modulation of a perovskite surface using thiol copper(II) porphyrin (CuP) to post-treat the perovskite film. The Raman spectra reveal that the CuP molecules anchor on the perovskite surface by a coordination interaction between the thiol-terminal of CuP and Pb ion in perovskite. DFT calculations demonstrate that the porphyrin core in CuP has a strong fixing effect on I− and I2 by the induction force and electrostatic attraction. Such a fixation was demonstrated by the shift of the UV absorption peak of I2 in solution with the addition of CuP and the decreased defects density in the CuP-treated perovskite film. Finally, the modified PSCs exhibit an improved cell performance with the best efficiency up to 21.76% (certified 20.97%). The modified PSCs acquired significantly improved stability. In addition, there is almost no lead leakage from the treated film immersed in water. This work provides a surface modulation strategy by thiol CuP treatment to fabricate efficient, stable, and environmental-friendly PSCs. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have attracted tremendous attention owing to their low fabrication cost and intriguing optical and electronic properties.1–6 The recently reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has exceed 25%.7 However, during the fabrication of polycrystalline perovskite films under the solution-based preparation process, the inevitably formed large number of undersaturated metal or halide ions at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite film can act as ion migration paths.8–10 Additionally, the I− is easily oxidized to I2 under environment condition, which can further cause chemical chain reactions to result in the degradation of perovskite film.11,12 The leakage of noxious lead also limits the practical application of PSCs.13,14 Thereby, effective modulation of perovskite surface and GBs of perovskite film is vital for fabricating efficient, stable, and environmental-friendly PSCs. Recently, a series of modified approaches have been developed to address the above issues.15–21 For instance, employing sulfate or phosphate ions to treat the surface of perovskite film yielded the lead oxysalt thin capping layer, thereby remarkably improving the environmental stability of PSCs.22 The usage of phenethylammonium iodide to modify the perovskite films realized the fabrication of higher-efficiency PSCs by reducing the defects and suppressing nonradiative recombination.23 Introducing other halide anions (such as F−, Cl−, or Br−) into perovskite film increased the lattice strain relaxation of perovskite, to improve the long-term durability of PSCs.24–26 In our recent work, the ammonium/amine porphyrin or phthalocyanine macromolecules with excellent photoelectric properties was used to treat the perovskite film to obtain efficient surface and GBs modification and interfacial charge transfer, thus significantly enhancing the performance and stability of PSCs.3,12,27 Since the defects mainly locate at the top surface of the perovskite film,10,28 it is still a challenge to effectively encapsulate and modulate the perovskite surface to fabricate the efficient, stable, and environmental-friendly PSCs. Here, by optimizing the structures of porphyrin molecules, we develop a strategy for molecular modulation of the perovskite surface using a thiol copper(II) porphyrin (CuP, shown in Figure 1a) to post-treat the perovskite film (Figure 1b). The thiol was selected as the peripheral functional group to firmly bind the CuP molecules on the surface of perovskite film by forming interfacial Pb–S bonds, thus to effectively passivate the surficial uncoordinated Pb ions and prevent lead leakage.29–31 Additionally, the Cu(II) ions in CuP can efficiently tune the electron distribution of porphyrin π ring, to achieve the effective fixation of I− and I2 on the porphyrin core in CuP by the induction force and electrostatic attraction, thus reducing the defects within the perovskite film. Finally, the PSCs with CuP modification revealed the significantly enhanced cell performance, and the best efficiency was up to 21.76% (certified 20.97%).The introduction of CuP produced efficient surface modulation and encapsulation of perovskite film, which further improves the cell stability and safety.

Then, the mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated with TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 18NR-T) in isopropanol (1∶7, mass ratio) at 5000 rpm for 25 s, and then annealed at 550 °C for 30 min. The Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared with the reported ratio.34 The perovskite film was formed by spin-coating the precursor solution on the mesoporous TiO2 at 4000 rpm for 25 s, and then 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was quickly dripped on the rotating surface at 6 s, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 1 min and at 120 °C for 2 min. For the post-treatment of perovskite film, the porphyrin in toluene solution was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 20 s. Subsequently, the Spiro-OMeTAD [Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (CB) (72 mg/mL) containing 17.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile (520 mg/mL) and 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP)] was spin-coated on the top of perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s as the hole transport material (HTM). Finally, 80 nm gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. Device characterization The current density–voltage (J–V) tests were recorded by using a solar simulator equipped with a 300 W collimated Xenon lamp (Newport) and Keithley 2400 source meter (Keithley, Cleveland, OH). The light intensity of the simulator was calibrated by the certified silicon solar cell to 100 mW/cm2 at air mass (AM) 1.5 G solar light condition. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was characterized on a computer-controlled IPCE system with a Xenon lamp, a Keithley multimeter and a monochromator. The device was calibrated with the certified silicon solar cell and the IPCE data were collected in direct current (DC) mode. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were acquired on Cu Kα radiation on a Rigaku RINT-2500 X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The surface morphology was recorded on a SEM-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). UV–vis absorption spectra were measured on a Cary-5000 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The steady and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Horiba FL-3 spectrometer (Horiba, United States). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and I–V measurements for the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analysis were prepared by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E; ChenHua, China). The methods of theoretical calculation are provided in the Supporting Information. Surficial work function of the perovskite films was performed by the scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) with an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Agilent SPM 5500; Agilent). Results and Discussion Perovskite surface modification with CuP by forming interfacial Pb–S bonds The synthesis of CuP is provided in the Supporting Information. For the CuP modification process in PSCs, the CuP varying in concentration from 0 to 3 mg/mL in toluene was used to post-treat the perovskite film. The optimized CuP concentration of 2 mg/mL was selected to prepare the following measurements. As shown in Supporting Information Figure S1, SEM images revealed a changed morphology of the CuP-treated perovskite film. This result was further observed in the AFM measurements. As shown in Figures 2a and 2b, the introduced CuP roughens the perovskite surface. A root mean square (RMS) analysis was performed and shown in Figures 2c and 2d. The value of the perovskite film was 6.69 nm, while the value of CuP-treated film was 5.67 nm. Since the capping layer was not observed in the SEM and AFM images, we concluded the self-assembly monolayer porphyrins may be anchored on the perovskite surface by the coordination effect of Pb from perovskite and S in porphyrin. The appearance of Cu peaks at 934.9 and 954.9 eV for the CuP-treated perovskite sample from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement indicates the existence of CuP within the treated perovskite film (see Supporting Information Figure S2). The shift of the S peak in the modified film (Figure 2e) is evidence for the coordination between Pb in perovskite and S from CuP. Figure 2 | AFM images of perovskite films without (a and c) and with CuP (b and d) post-treatment. XPS spectra for elemental S (e) and Raman spectra (f) of CuP and perovskite with and without CuP treatment. Download figure Download PowerPoint Considering that it is difficult for the large CuP to enter the 3D perovskite lattice, the introduced CuP molecules should stay on the surface of the perovskite film. This hypothesis was reflected by the similar optical absorption spectra and XRD patterns (see Supporting Information Figure S3) of the perovskite films with and without CuP treatment. To understand how CuP functionalizes the perovskite film surface, Raman spectroscopy tests were performed and shown in Figure 2f. The appearance of new peaks for the CuP-treated perovskite sample at 415, 748, and 816 cm−1 assigned to the Pb–S bond35–37 indicates that the thiol in CuP can react with the surficial Pb ion from the perovskite film. It can be concluded that the CuP molecules anchor on the perovskite surface by forming interfacial Pb–S bonds between perovskite and CuP. The cross-sectional elemental maps of perovskite with CuP post-treatment further confirmed the CuP mainly located on the top surface of the perovskite film (see Supporting Information Figure S4). Effect of the introduced CuP on the interfacial property of perovskite film Effective modulation of the interfacial I− and I2 defects of perovskite film is vital for the fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs. Studies revealed that the I2 defects within perovskite film could be reduced or captured by aromatic rings,6 thus we speculated that the porphyrin ring would have a similar property. The Cu(II) ion with the unoccupied d orbital would tune the electron distribution of the porphyrin ring in CuP to capture and immobilize I− and I2 defects within perovskite films. To investigate the above hypothesis, the free-base porphyrin (P) and zinc porphyrin (ZnP) were also designed as control samples. Electrostatic potential images of the porphyrin molecules were prepared by density functional theory (DFT) calculation and shown in Supporting Information Figure S5. We can clearly observe that the introduction of metal ions in porphyrin cores results in an increased central charge intensity within the porphyrin core compared with the P, which probably facilitates the adsorption of I− and I2. The change of the Gibbs free energy (ΔGgas, kcal/mol) for I− and I2 adsorbed on the central porphyrin ring in different molecules bound on perovskite surfaces was also calculated (Figure 3a and Supporting Information Figure S6). As listed in Table 1, the metal porphyrin-based systems revealed a decreased ΔGgas to fix I− and I2 compared with the P. The results suggest the central metal ions can tune the electron distribution within the porphyrin core to fix I− and I2 on the central porphyrin rings.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Table 1 | Variation of Gibbs Free Energy (ΔGgas, kcal/mol) of I− and I2 Fixed on the Central Porphyrin Rings in Different Molecules by DFT Calculation P ZnP CuP I− 6.47 −6.10 −12.95 I2 −1.16 −4.11 −3.91 We used the Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) method to further dynamically analyze the movement law of I− and I2 on the porphyrin molecules bound on the surface of perovskite lattices. The stable equilibrium structures were selected in the simulation process and shown in Figure 3a. The more negative interaction energy of the CuP-based system is observed (Figures 3b and 3c), indicating that the CuP-based system has the strongest fixing effect on the I− and I2 at room temperature. Generally, the van der Waals (vdW) potential reflects well the attraction of different atoms to specific atoms, and the effect of the vdW potential is dominant for the interaction between nonpolar molecules. To deeply understand the mechanism of the porphyrin system’s fixation effect on I− and I2, we conducted the vdW potential and independent gradient model (IGM) analyses of the stable structures during the BOMD processes. The mathematical definition of vdW potential is38: V vdW ( r ) = V repul ( r ) + V disp ( r ) = ∑ A ɛ AB ( R AB 0 | R A − r | ) 12 + ∑ A [ − 2 ɛ AB ( R AB 0 | R A v − r | ′ ) 6 ] where the Vrepul( r) and Vdisp( r) are the exchange mutual exclusion potential and dispersion attraction potential in vdW potential, which produce positive contribution and negative contribution, respectively. All atoms in the A cycle, ɛ, and R AB 0 are the depth and equilibrium distances of the Lennard–Jones potential between atoms; RA represents the nuclear coordinates of the A atom. In the molecular force field, the vdW parameters of different atoms may be distinct, thereby both ɛ and R AB 0 are atom dependent. In the vdW potential as defined above, the B atom is equivalent to the probe atom. The iodine atom was used as a probe in our calculation, which is in accordance with the actual situation. As shown in Figure 3d, the vdW potential distribution of I− is spherically symmetric, and the distribution of attractors is vacant perpendicular to the paper surface. This is due to the exposure of the d-orbital in the I atom. The vdW potential isosurface near the porphyrin ring has a notch partly circular, while the vdW potential isosurface of I− and I2 has a closed surface. Therefore, I− and I2 can be attracted to the porphyrin ring. There are more attractors near the porphyrin ring with a metal core, which can help fix the I− and I2. The IGM isosurface analyses are shown in Figure 3e. The green and blue isosurface represent vdW and electrostatic interaction, respectively.39 The size of the isosurface reflects the size of attraction. The CuP-based system reveals the larger attractive forces to the I− and I2 than those of P- or ZnP-based systems, indicating that the CuP bound on perovskite surface can more effectively fix the I− and I2 than the P or ZnP. The colored IGM isosurface indicates there are two types of interactions between the metal porphyrin ring and I− and I2 (Figure 3e). One part is the green vdW interaction, and the other part is the blue electrostatic interaction. To quantitatively analyze the relationship between the electrostatic attraction and vdW interaction, we used the symmetric-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) method to quantitatively calculate the intermolecular interaction energy between CuP and I− or I2. As shown in Table 2, it was found that the main interaction energy is the inducing force (−175.30 and −181.33 kcal/mol to I− and I2, respectively). While the electrostatic interaction energy also reaches −80.44 and −89.98 kcal/mol for I− and I2, respectively, an interaction energy component that cannot be ignored. Therefore, it can be concluded that the fixing effect of I− and I2 on CuP is dominated by the induction force and supplemented by electrostatic attraction, thus effectively modulating the perovskite surface. Table 2 | Intermolecular Interaction Energy (kcal/mol) of I− and I2 Fixed on the Central Porphyrin Ring in CuP by SAPT Calculation CuP-I− CuP-I2 Electrostatics −80.44 −89.98 Exchange 33.28 45.86 Induction −175.30 −181.33 Dispersion −7.49 −6.17 To experimentally confirm the above results, the P and ZnP (Figure 1a) were synthesized and used to post-treat the perovskite films (see Supporting Information Figures S7 and S8). The synthetic processes of P and ZnP are provided in the Supporting Information. To demonstrate that CuP has an effective fixing ability on I2, the UV–vis absorption spectra for I2 in CH2Cl2/ethyl acetate (V/V = 1/1) solution with the addition of P, ZnP, and CuP were tested. As shown in Supporting Information Figure S9, the absorption peak of I2 was blue-shifted with the addition of CuP. In contrast, there was almost no change with the introduction of P or ZnP. These results indicate the CuP can effectively fix the I2. Confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (CLSFM) measurements were prepared to study the microstructure characteristic relationships of perovskite films with and without treatment. As illustrated in Figures 4a and 4b and Supporting Information Figure S10, the surface of pristine perovskite film exhibited substantial local PL heterogeneity, while an obviously brighter region in the CuP-modified perovskite film was observed, suggesting that the CuP post-treatment could activate partial dark regions at the perovskite film surface, which was consistent with previous reports.40–42 The steady and transient PL measurements were performed to confirm the above results. Compared with the perovskite films with and without P or ZnP modification, the CuP-based perovskite film revealed an enhanced steady-state PL intensity (see Supporting Information Figure S11a). The obtained decay time of transient PL for the CuP-based film (181.6 ns) was also larger than those of perovskite films with and without P or ZnP treatment (36.7, 85.2, and 88.8 ns for the pure perovskite film, P- and ZnP-modified perovskite films, as shown in Figure 4c and Supporting Information Figure S11b). The SCLC tests were further used to evaluate quantitatively the defects’ densities of perovskite films. The trap-state density (nt) was calculated according to the relation: nt = (2ɛɛ0VTFL)/(eL2), where ɛ is the dielectric constant of perovskite, ɛ0 is the vacuum permittivity, L is the thickness of perovskite film, and e is the elementary charge.43–46 As shown in Figure 4d and Supporting Information Figure S12b, the nt for CuP-treated perovskite films was determined to be 1.40 × 1016 cm−3, which was lower than those of the perovskite without (4.21 × 1016 cm−3) and with P (2.71 × 1016 cm−3) and ZnP (2.18 × 1016 cm−3) treatment (see Supporting Information Figure S12b). The above results clearly confirm that introduction of CuP on the surface of perovskite film can effectively reduce the defects at the surface of perovskite film.

(f) Best J–V data of PSCs with and without CuP post-treatment tested in reverse scan (RS) and forward scan (FS). Download figure Download PowerPoint The interfacial energy level distribution between perovskite and modifier is crucial for the interfacial charge extraction and transport. We employed CV to determine the energy levels of P, ZnP, and CuP. As shown in Supporting Information Figure S13, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of P, ZnP, and CuP locate at −4.79, −4.88, and −4.96 eV, respectively. These results indicate the CuP HOMO is closer in energy level to the Spiro-OMeTAD HOMO (−5.22 eV) to realize the charge transfer and enhance the cell efficiency. To confirm the energy level of CuP coordinated on the surface of perovskite film, the surficial work function of the perovskite films without and with CuP modification were analyzed via SKPM measurements. As illustrated in Supporting Information Figures S14 and S15, the contact potential difference (CPD) of the pure perovskite film was ∼350 mV, while the CPD of CuP-modified perovskite film changed to ∼550 mV. The results suggest the surficial work function of perovskite modified by CuP is adjusted to −5.23 eV, slightly lower than the HOMO level of Spiro-OMeTAD (Figure 4e). This indicates the introduction of CuP on the perovskite surface can facilitate the efficient charge transfer between perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD, probably enhancing the efficiency of PSCs. Effect of CuP on device efficiency Devices with the structure of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous- TiO2/Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated to evaluate the effect of CuP on the corresponding PSCs (see Supporting Information Figure S16). To assess whether the CuP on the surface of the perovskite layer was dissolved during the deposition of the HTM layer, we employed chlorobenzene (CB) to treat the CuP-modified perovskite film. Raman spectroscopy of the films with and without CB-treatment was then conducted. As shown in Supporting Information Figure S17, the films with and without CB treatment have similar spectra. This result confirms the successful fabrication of PSCs with CuP-modified perovskite in this work. The cell performances of PSCs were then evaluated and shown in Figure 4f, Supporting Information Figure S18, and Table S1. The PSCs’ efficiencies improved as the content of CuP increased from 0 to 3 mg/mL. The best efficiency of the CuP-modified PSC (2 mg/mL post-treatment) was 21.76%, which was further certified as 20.97% cell performance (see Supporting Information Figure S19). In contrast, the best efficiency of the PSC with pure perovskite was 20.01%. A remarkably reduced hysteresis of modified PSC with CuP was also observed (Figure 4f and Supporting Information Table S2). Measurements over 30 cells modified with CuP gave an average efficiency of 21.0 ± 0.8%. The efficiencies of control PSCs averaged 19.1% ± 1.0% (see Supporting Information Figure S20). In addition, the cell performances of PSCs with P and ZnP were also tested. The results revealed that the best performances of PSCs with P and ZnP were 20.76% and 21.12%, respectively (see Supporting Information Figure S21 and Table S4), which were lower than that of PSCs with CuP. Accordingly, the introduction of CuP on the perovskite surface demonstrated effective interfacial modulation to reduce the interfacial defects, and thus remarkably improved the performance of PSCs. Effect of CuP on device stability As shown in Supporting Information Figure S22, the contact angle of a water droplet on the CuP-modified perovskite film obviously increased when compared to that of the pure perovskite film. The water-resistance properties of perovskites films with and without CuP modification were further assessed by immersing the films into water solution. As shown in Figures 5a–5c, the pure perovskite film quickly turned yellow after 2 s, but the perovskite film treated with CuP remained black after 25 s. Since the PSCs with Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM have poor moisture and thermal stability (see Supporting Information Figure S23),47 the long-term stabilities of PSCs with the structure of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/perovskite/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/Au were performed (see Supporting Information Figure S24 and Table S3, all PSCs without encapsulation in this work) to assess the effect of CuP on the stability of perovskite film. As shown in Figure 5d, after 3000 h with a humidity of 45%, the CuP-modified device retained 90% of the original efficiency. The reference PSC almost failed under the same conditions. These results indicate the CuP achieves the effective encapsulation of the perovskite film, thereby impeding the permeation of water into perovskite film.

The layer thickness was about 10 nm, and the basal planes of the layered atomic packing were oriented predominantly parallel to the substrate surface over the entire thickness of the layers. The study of tribological properties was carried out by the method of sliding a ball over a disk in a nitrogen atmosphere with varying the load on the counter body from 5 to 9 N. The value of the friction coefficient depended on the load on the counter body.

Vapor phase epitaxy was initially developed using chloride and hydride compounds, and later improved by the introduction of new precursors and methodologies such as metal-organic compounds and atomic layer epitaxy. Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy is based on the principle that metalorganics and hydrides precursors are cracked on a hot substrate where the deposition takes place. These precursors are transported in the growth chamber by a carrier gas (usually hydrogen). In Atomic layer epitaxy, the precursors are introduced alternately into the growth chamber, followed by a cleaning/purge step with a carrier gas.

As the performance of AFM depends greatly on the properties of the cantilevers, many works have been carried out to improve cantilevers by means of modifying their geometries via lithography [1] and ion beam milling [2,3] that primarily involve opening areas on the cantilever's face, resulting in high resonant frequency, low spring constant, and low hydrodynamic damping. Similar improvements were achieved using a hollow beam cantilever with nanoscale wall thickness [4]. In fact, the combination of these two approaches (in-plane opening and hollow beam) can result in unique metamaterial structures with tunable properties [5], but it has not been explored for AFM application. In this work, we explore hollow AFM cantilevers with in-plane modifications. We accomplish this by (1) taking a commercial solid silicon cantilever, (2) making a different number of holes on the face using pulsed laser micromachining, and (3) coating it with alumina using atomic layer deposition and etching the internal silicon which results in a hollow probe with holes. We present the effects of these modifications on the cantilever's resonant frequency, quality factor, and spring constant in air. This work provides an insight into strategies for tuning a cantilever's properties for both flexural and torsional modes.

It was found that during the deposition of a layered structure, the Dy and Co layers are partially mixed with the formation of the DyCo2 intermetallic compound. The profiles of the magnetization of individual layers at the atomic level were determined. It was managed to describe a noncollinear magnetic structure of the layers near the compensation point using the neutron reflectometry data. The triple hysteresis loops observed in the same temperature range most likely indicated the non-identity of the outer and inner superlattice layers. The inhomogeneity profile of the DyCo2 layer magnetization distribution can be explained by the strong exchange interaction at the interfaces. In a small applied magnetic field, the interlayer exchange interaction dominates over by the Zeeman energy. The antuparallel ordering of the magnetic moments of the Co and DyCo2 layers was distorted by the magnetic field; as a result, the angle between the magnetization vectors was maximum at the Co/DyCo2 interfaces only.",поверхность рентгеновские синхротронные и нейтронные исследования,['1028-0960'],journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1975977010', 'https://openalex.org/W1987537947', 'https://openalex.org/W1992866046', 'https://openalex.org/W2004240392', 'https://openalex.org/W2005289380', 'https://openalex.org/W2010358868', 'https://openalex.org/W2011125191', 'https://openalex.org/W2012695793', 'https://openalex.org/W2033836950', 'https://openalex.org/W2153801134', 'https://openalex.org/W2156257671', 'https://openalex.org/W2218427988', 'https://openalex.org/W2484386922', 'https://openalex.org/W2564089647', 'https://openalex.org/W2605100914', 'https://openalex.org/W2608733100', 'https://openalex.org/W2745896347', 'https://openalex.org/W2772481406', 'https://openalex.org/W2966406701', 'https://openalex.org/W3105595334']",Макарова,,False,

For example, the PEC approach can find application in the synthesis of multi-carbon-based hydrocarbons (C2+) by solar driven reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2R), and in the generation of hydrogen by solar water splitting. However, the electrochemical environment poses significant challenges to the performance and stability of semiconductor based photoelectrodes. Tackling these challenges requires careful understanding of the behaviour of photoelectrode interfaces at the microscopic scale. Here we show examples of characterization techniques that can help to quantify the performance and stability of photoelectrode surfaces with nanometer resolution, using, as a model system, thin films of TiO2 deposited for corrosion protection by atomic layer deposition (ALD). A detailed analysis of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements under intermittent illumination allows us to analyze the evolution of surface potential over time and extract localized time constants for carrier dynamic processes on the surface. Furthermore, using operando spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), we can directly quantify the intrinsic stability of these protective overlayers under PEC water splitting conditions, particularly as a function of the degree of crystallinity of the TiO2 film. In addition, we show how rationally designed catalytic environments can significantly improve the stability and performance of photoelectrodes for PEC CO2R. We demonstrate that by tuning microenvironmental factors such as pH, wettability, and CO2 mass transport, we can enhance C2+ selectivity on halide perovskite photoelectrodes. Understanding photoelectrode interfaces at the micro and nanoscale allows the systematic improvement of photoelectrode stability and performance, opening avenues for the implementation of PEC technologies towards sustainable energy production and climate change mitigation. © FUNDACIO DE LA COMUNITAT VALENCIANA SCITOnanoGe is a prestigious brand of successful science conferences that are developed along the year in different areas of the world since 2009.

In this contribution, we implemented piezoresponse force and conductive atomic force microscopies to study the layer-by-layer sol-gel deposition of BiFeO3 thin films focusing on the local phase distribution, morphology, piezoelectric response, and leakage current. The final properties of resulting thin films are found to be determined not only by the composition of the gel and crystallization step but by the gelation step as well. The drying temperature and treatment duration of the solution is shown to drastically influence the film coverage, which finally determines the morphology of the films and behavior of the crystallization process.

A decrease in the absorption edge slope and dip in the bandgap was observed away from pH2. The bandgap of the post-growth treated CdTe layers showed enhancement as it leans towards 1.45 eV, with the trend retention of absorption edge slope, similar to the as-deposited CdTe layers.

Kushner, Mingmei Wang, Peter Biolsi","Fluorocarbon, Chemical Mechanical Planarization, Deposition","Atomic layer etching (ALE) is a cyclic plasma process used in semiconductor fabrication that can remove single layers of atoms during each cycle provided each step is self-terminating.

As a result, ALE performance is a delicate balance between deposition of polymer during the first half of the cycle and etching (with polymer removal) during the second half. In the absence of complete removal of the overlying polymer in each cycle, ALE may be transient as the polymer thickness grows with each cycle. With small amounts of polymer left on the surface, roughening may be reinforced by there being a variation in polymer thickness.",2020 ieee international conference on plasma science (icops),,conference,0,[],Wang,,False,

С. Олешко, K.M. Makhanov","Crystal (programming language), Cubic crystal system, Surface layer","An empirical model of a solid surface is proposed in the article. The thickness of the surface layer is described in terms of one parameter – the atomic volume of an element or its compounds. Surface energy is also expressed through one parameter – the melting point of a chemical element or crystal. The model proposes equations that allow calculating the thickness of the surface layer and surface energy for each face of the crystal. As an example, calculations of these values are made for silicides of some metals with crystal structures of cubic, hexagonal and rhombic systems. For cubic silicides, the thickness of the surface layer is 3-9 nm, and the number of monolayers is 7-16. Studies of metal deposition on silicon faces have shown that silicon silicide is formed on the (111) face, which has the highest surface energy. The reaction on the (100) face occurs only on the oxidized surface. In hexagonal silicides, anisotropy is seen, both in the values of thethickness of the surface layer and in the values of the surface energy. For example, during the formation of chromium disilicide on the (111) face in the c direction, it was found that the sizes of the islands become larger than on the (001) face. The authors designate that the thickness of the surface layer and the specificsurface energy for cubic, hexagonal, and rhombic crystals significantly differ from them. What is the difference? First, the difference between the atoms of chemical elements from the periodic table and their compounds depends, first of all, on their electronic structure, which forms this or that interaction potential.Secondly, the difference between cubic, hexagonal and rhombic crystals lies in their relationship with Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus, that is, on two material parameters. Third, the thickness of the surface layer between cubic, hexagonal, and rhombic crystals also differs in only one parameter – the atomic (molar)volume of the crystal.

Rumaiz, Syed Ismat Shah","Physical vapor deposition, Ion plating, Deposition","Abstract Thin films are commonly utilized in industries such as electronics, packaging, decoration, and protection. The two primary techniques for thin‐film deposition include physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The selection and application of a particular technique depends on the desired properties of thin films. For example, for electronic applications where via filling is a requirement, preference is for the CVD process where gaseous precursor finds its way to all spaces, forming a uniform thin film on the whole topography. PVD techniques have limitation that the substrate surface has to be in the line of sight of the incoming flux. Contoured surfaces require special source and substrate manipulation for conformal coatings. Likewise, where large flat surface area coverage is needed, like thin films on decorative window glass, a simpler process such as PVD, both as evaporation and sputtering, is preferred over CVD. This article describes PVD and CVD techniques and their multiple variants. PVD processes, evaporation, sputtering, and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with their variants, ion plating and high‐power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS), form the first part of the article, whereas the second part contains descriptions of CVD processes, including metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and plasma‐assisted (or enhanced) chemical vapor deposition (PACVD). Notably absent in this article are molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), a PVD process and atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), a CVD process. These are very controlled deposition processes and require sophisticated control hardware. It is this sophistication that requires MBE and ALD to be dealt separately and, therefore, not included in this article.",kirk-othmer encyclopedia of chemical technology,,journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1578696950', 'https://openalex.org/W1622544330', 'https://openalex.org/W1651300798', 'https://openalex.org/W1956351353', 'https://openalex.org/W1963970342', 'https://openalex.org/W1965487912', 'https://openalex.org/W1966385378', 'https://openalex.org/W1971175464', 'https://openalex.org/W1972236320', 'https://openalex.org/W1972980261', 'https://openalex.org/W1974140104', 'https://openalex.org/W1974213493', 'https://openalex.org/W1976557223', 'https://openalex.org/W1979034063', 'https://openalex.org/W1981340625', 'https://openalex.org/W1983532124', 'https://openalex.org/W1984195262', 'https://openalex.org/W1985561556', 'https://openalex.org/W1987770905', 'https://openalex.org/W1988848866', 'https://openalex.org/W1989426774', 'https://openalex.org/W1995314814', 'https://openalex.org/W2001534807', 'https://openalex.org/W2001664233', 'https://openalex.org/W2002012254', 'https://openalex.org/W2002041708', 'https://openalex.org/W2002304789', 'https://openalex.org/W2002356291', 'https://openalex.org/W2003339627', 'https://openalex.org/W2003359776', 'https://openalex.org/W2010129426', 'https://openalex.org/W2011132809', 'https://openalex.org/W2011899447', 'https://openalex.org/W2014464006', 'https://openalex.org/W2020318405', 'https://openalex.org/W2021717250', 'https://openalex.org/W2023951156', 'https://openalex.org/W2028278961', 'https://openalex.org/W2028370647', 'https://openalex.org/W2034236995', 'https://openalex.org/W2039685169', 'https://openalex.org/W2043264666', 'https://openalex.org/W2048341035', 'https://openalex.org/W2049038819', 'https://openalex.org/W2050449443', 'https://openalex.org/W2051580914', 'https://openalex.org/W2054973533', 'https://openalex.org/W2057129242', 'https://openalex.org/W2060973050', 'https://openalex.org/W2061814785', 'https://openalex.org/W2063811240', 'https://openalex.org/W2072278390', 'https://openalex.org/W2073381699', 'https://openalex.org/W2073818933', 'https://openalex.org/W2073854065', 'https://openalex.org/W2074755940', 'https://openalex.org/W2077295501', 'https://openalex.org/W2080168375', 'https://openalex.org/W2084614192', 'https://openalex.org/W2085177141', 'https://openalex.org/W2087261822', 'https://openalex.org/W2087838097', 'https://openalex.org/W2090578271', 'https://openalex.org/W2090682544', 'https://openalex.org/W2094738288', 'https://openalex.org/W2095823722', 'https://openalex.org/W2105943135', 'https://openalex.org/W2115786064', 'https://openalex.org/W2131720871', 'https://openalex.org/W2147894069', 'https://openalex.org/W2152941585', 'https://openalex.org/W2160430137', 'https://openalex.org/W2164673287', 'https://openalex.org/W2165473204', 'https://openalex.org/W2181292386', 'https://openalex.org/W2329006827', 'https://openalex.org/W2335370736', 'https://openalex.org/W2404978934', 'https://openalex.org/W2482098144', 'https://openalex.org/W2508045233', 'https://openalex.org/W2599665317', 'https://openalex.org/W2744567087', 'https://openalex.org/W2770751227', 'https://openalex.org/W2800503532', 'https://openalex.org/W2801125766', 'https://openalex.org/W285475345', 'https://openalex.org/W2901950430', 'https://openalex.org/W2943054892', 'https://openalex.org/W2951387534', 'https://openalex.org/W2963817587', 'https://openalex.org/W2972951620', 'https://openalex.org/W3020096896', 'https://openalex.org/W3130798502', 'https://openalex.org/W4241180980', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527', 'https://openalex.org/W4292230197', 'https://openalex.org/W4298019739', 'https://openalex.org/W617017326']",Ruzybayev,,False,

The experiments were carried out in situ in ultrahigh vacuum. The analysis of the samples is performed by high-energy-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation, low-energy electron diffraction, and also Raman spectroscopy, atomic-force and kelvin-probe microscopies. The thicknesses of the deposited cobalt and silicon layers is varied to 2 nm, and the sample temperature, from room temperature to 1000°C. Co and Si atoms deposited on heated samples is found to penetrate under graphene and are localized between the buffer layer and the substrate, which leads to a transformation of the buffer layer into additional graphene layer. It is shown that the result of intercalation of the system with cobalt and silicon is the formation under two-layer graphene of a Co–Si solid solution and silicide CoSi coated by the surface Co_3Si phase. It is shown that the thickness and the composition of the formed silicide films can be changed by varying the amount of the intercalated material and the order of their depositions.",физика твердого тела,"['0367-3294', '1726-7498']",journal,0,[],Гребенюк,,False,

The synthesis of epitaxial silicene on Ag(111) is usually performed in two steps, involving the preparation of the smooth substrate surface, followed by the Si deposition and the 2D layer formation. Epitaxial growth of silicene begins with the selection of the substrate material, its orientation and finally its proper preparation. The crystalline quality of the 2D adlayer will strongly depend on the surface quality of the substrate. The electronic properties of any crystalline material strongly depend on the atomic arrangement and bonding configuration of its lattice, which also accounts for 2D crystalline materials such as silicene. The absence of real Dirac cones at the epitaxial silicene K points is also supported by scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements in a magnetic field at low temperatures.",crc press ebooks,,ebook platform,0,[],Solonenko,,False,

As the infinite-layer nickelates are obtained by removing the apical oxygens from the precursor perovskite phase, the crystalline quality of the perovskite phase is crucial in synthesizing high quality superconducting nickelates. Especially, cation-related defects, such as the Ruddlesden-Popper-type (RP-type) faults, are unlikely to disappear after the topotactic reduction process and should be avoided during the growth of the perovskite phase. Herein, using reactive molecular beam epitaxy, we report the atomic-scale engineering of the interface structure and demonstrate its impact in reducing crystalline defects in Nd-based nickelate/SrTiO 3 heterostructures. A simultaneous deposition of stoichiometric Nd and Ni directly on SrTiO 3 substrate results in prominent Nd vacancies and Ti diffusion at the interface and RP-type defects in nickelate films. In contrast, inserting an extra [NdO] monolayer before the simultaneous deposition of Nd and Ni forms a sharp interface and greatly eliminates RP-type defects in nickelate films. A possible explanation related to the polar discontinuity is also discussed.

Muon to electron conversion is one example that the COMET experiment aims to measure with increased sensitivity over previous searches. Taking a staged approach, the COMET experiment will measure muon to electron conversion with sensitivities of O ( 10 − 15 ) and O ( 10 − 17 ) in Phase-I and Phase-II, respectively. An important initial low-intensity beam run, Phase- α , is also planned to begin in 2023 with Phase-I following in 2024. This article summarises the COMET experiment and the recent progress made towards the beginning of physics runs. Keywords: muon physics; detectors; flavour physics; J-PARC; particle physics experiment 1. IntroductionCharged lepton flavour violation (CLFV) provides a unique experimental probe in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. It is known and understood that flavour violation can be observed in the quark and neutral lepton sectors of the Standard Model, leaving the question open as to whether it exists in the charged lepton sector. Muon to electron ( μ -e) conversion is one example of CLFV, in which a muon captured by an atomic nucleus is converted coherently in an electron. If one only considers Standard Model physics plus neutrino oscillations, μ -e conversion is extremely suppressed to the point of being unobservable, with conversion ratios in the range of O ( 10 − 55 ) . Many beyond Standard Models (BSM), however, predict it to be enhanced with conversion ratios of up to O ( 10 − 15 ) , which is within the modern experimental sensitivity reach, making μ -e conversion a powerful probe, as any observation would be unambiguous evidence of new physics. Many well-motivated BSMs facilitate CLFV, such as models that introduce supersymmetric light particles, leptoquark models, and heavy Z ′ models (e.g., [1,2] and summarised in [3]). One can also consider effective field theories that introduce dipole operators and four-fermi contact operators which, when combined with bounds from related CLFV experiments, such as μ → e γ and μ → e e e , can reveal information about the structure of the new physics [4].To observe μ -e conversion experimentally, muons are stopped in some target materials where they transition to the 1s state of a nucleus, after which they decay with some target-material-dependent lifetime. Muons undergoing μ -e conversion will have the distinct signature of a single monoenergetic electron with a momentum of E e ≈ 104.97 MeV [5], accounting for energy losses due to nuclear recoil and the muon binding with the nucleus. The major background of any measurement of μ -e conversion will come from the Standard Model muon decay, referred to as decay in orbit (DIO) for captured muons. While most DIO-produced electrons will be of low momentum and simple to suppress, the DIO momentum spectrum does reach the μ -e conversion momentum range when considering the sensitivity levels of next-generation μ -e conversion experiments [6]. This means an excellent momentum resolution is required in addition to other types of background suppression, such as beam-related backgrounds and cosmic muons. The Coherent Muon to Electron Transition (COMET) experiment [3] is one such next-generation experiment that searches for μ -e conversion with the greatest sensitivity yet surpasses the conversion ratio limit of 7.0 × 10 − 13 for μ -e conversion in gold set by SINDRUM II [7]. 2. The COMET Experiment 2.1. OverviewTo search for the μ -e conversion in aluminium, the COMET experiment is being constructed in Hadron Hall at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan. The COMET experiment will adopt a phased structure, including a pre-physics run beam line commissioning Phase- α and two physics runs, Phase-I and Phase-II, and is expected to reach sensitivity limits of 3.1 × 10 − 15 [3] and 1.4 × 10 − 17 [8], respectively. In order to improve on previous sensitivity limits, COMET requires high statistics and excellent background suppression as well as excellent momentum resolution to separate the signal from the tail end of the DIO electron spectrum. A pulsed beam structure will be used in order to remove beam-related backgrounds, while optimised curved solenoids and dipole fields will be used to remove high-momentum backgrounds during muon beam transport. Detectors are optimised in both Phase-I and -II to suppress low-momentum electron events, and veto detectors are used in both phases to remove cosmic muon events. An overview of the three phases is shown in Figure 1 and can be summarised as follows:Phase-α: Phase- α is a low-intensity beam commissioning run that is essential for Phase-I preparations. Phase- α will include a number of important studies, including further proton beam extinction measurements, studies on the properties of the COMET muon beam, and transport solenoid selection capabilities, pion yield and cross-sectional measurements, secondary beam particle measurements, and further validation studies of COMET simulations.Phase-I: A pulsed proton beam will be used to generate the world’s highest intensity muon beam producing an order of O ( 10 18 ) muons that will be stopped on aluminium targets, resulting in approximately 1.2 × 10 9 muons stopped per second. Charge and momentum selection of muons is provided by a curved solenoid with optimised dipole fields. The main physics detector surrounding the stopping targets is called the Cylindrical Detector (CyDet) system, and this is further discussed in Section 2.3. Phase-I is expected to involve the collection of physics data for 150 days beginning in 2024. The full details are outlined in [3].Phase-II: In Phase-II, the collection of physics data for 260 days following Phase-I with increased proton beam power is planned. This will improve sensitivity limits over Phase-I with some key design factors being the usage of a full C-shaped muon transport solenoid for further beam suppression, an additional curved electron spectrometer for further suppression of DIO electrons and beam-related backgrounds, and the use of an upgraded straw tracker + electron calorimeter (StrECAL) detector for physics measurements. 2.2. Proton Beam, Pion Capture, and Muon TransportThe 30 GeV main ring at J-PARC provides the 8 GeV proton beam used for the COMET experiment with a pulsed structure in order to avoid the majority of the beam-related backgrounds and using approximately 1 μ s spaced bunches to match the lifetime of muonic aluminium. In Phase-I, the beam power will be 3.2 kW, which will increase to 56 kW for Phase-II. Recent beam commissioning measurements showed interbunch extinction protons to be O ( 10 − 10 ) , meeting the requirements for Phase-I [9]. The proton beam will be impinged on a graphite pion production target in Phase-I and upgraded to tungsten in Phase-II for increased pion yields. A 5 T capture solenoid will be used to direct pions into the muon transport solenoid. In Phase-I, a 90 ∘ curved transport solenoid will be used, and this will be upgraded to a full C-shaped solenoid for Phase-II. The muons produced from pion decay inside the transport solenoid follow a helical trajectory where an additional tuned dipole field is used to compensate for drift and allow for momentum selection in conjunction with beam collimators at the end. Low-momentum muons are selected for and directed into the stopping targets. 2.3. Muon Stopping Targets and DetectorsThe stopping target system for Phase-I consists of 17 aluminium discs, 100 mm in radius and 200 μ m in thickness, present in the centre of the detector region. Aluminium was chosen for COMET as it provides a good tradeoff between the muon capture rate, DIO electron endpoint tail, and muonic atom lifetime which, for muonic aluminium, is 864 ns [10]. A support structure for the stopping targets will be integrated into the Phase-I detector system’s support structure.As mentioned in Section 2.1, the CyDet system provides the main physics measurements for Phase-I. At a high level, a Cylindrical Drift Chamber (CDC) provides the tracking and momentum information for the stopped muon decay products, and a Cylindrical Trigger Hodoscope (CTH) provides additional timing information, triggering on high-momentum particles. The CyDet system is surrounded by a 1 T magnetic detector solenoid such that charged particle products follow a helical trajectory towards the ends of the detector region. High radiation levels will be present in the detector region with 10 12 n eq / cm 2 neutrons and 1 kGy gamma rays expected [11].The CDC detector is a drift chamber consisting of 20 concentric wire layers (including two guard layers) with alternating positive and negative stereo angles of ±70 mrad. A total of 4986 25 μ m gold-plated tungsten sense wires and 14,562 126 μ m pure aluminium field wires are used in a He:i C 4 H 10 gas mixture. A large inner wall radius of 496 mm was designed such that low-momentum DIO electrons will be suppressed from reaching the sense layers within the detector’s solenoid field. The CDC was also designed such that high-momentum signal electrons will be contained within the detection volume for better momentum resolution. Overall, a momentum resolution of better than 200 keV/c is expected for signal electrons. The CDC uses Belle-II-based RECBE boards for readout [12].The CTH detector consists of two layers of 64 concentric scintillator counter rings located on both the upstream and downstream sides of the CDC detector, with the photon readout provided by multipixel photon counter (MPPC) photodetectors via plastic optical fibre bundles due to the high radiation levels. The main principle behind its background suppression is the four-fold coincidence in the counter layers, as low momentum backgrounds will not penetrate this far. The support structure includes an inner lead shielding layer as well as providing a tilt angle to the counters that is optimised for signal electron acceptance. The CTH detector requires a timing resolution of better than 1 ns.A cosmic ray veto (CRV) detector is critical for excluding atmospheric muon events in both Phase-I and Phase-II. The CRV detector provides both passive shielding through its inner-wall materials and active shielding through four layers of scintillator modules read out by silicon photomultipliers. In Phase-I, this detector will cover the CyDet region and bridge solenoid at the end of the muon transport solenoid and has a requirement of 99.99% efficiency and a dead time of less than 5%.The StrECAL detector will be the main physics detector for Phase-II, with an initial version being tested in Phase-I. The straw tube tracker, consisting of five straw stations with four straw planes each, will provide momentum information, while the electron calorimeter will provide energy, timing, and positional information. In Phase-I, the straws will be 20 μ m mylar + 70 nm aluminium thick with a 9.8 mm ϕ gauge, while in Phase-II, the straws will be reduced to 12 μ m mylar + 70 nm aluminium thick with a 5.0 mm ϕ gauge. A gas mixture of Ar:Ethane (50:50) is used and the average spatial resolution measured is less than 150 μ m which allows for better than 200 keV/c momentum resolution [13]. In terms of the electron calorimeter, LYSO crystals are being used with avalanche photodiodes for readout. In a 105 MeV electron prototype test, it was shown that the energy resolution ( σ E /E) is 4%, the positional resolution ( σ x ) is 0.6 cm, and the time resolution ( σ t ) is 0.5 ns, which all meet the necessary requirements [13]. The Phase-II design will improve the LYSO crystal coverage. 2.4. Software, Trigger and DAQ SystemThe COMET collaboration utilises an offline software framework based on the ND280 detector software framework from the T2K experiment that allows for full physics simulations with realistic geometry and magnetic field implementation as well as full detector calibration, reconstruction, and analysis. Mass production runs of simulation data have been used to optimise the COMET experiment’s design and improve offline event reconstruction and tracking.The trigger system for COMET is essential for suppressing the number of background events. The Phase-I trigger system collects information from the CDC and CTH detectors via front-end and merger boards that feed into an FC7 [14] central trigger board that makes the final decision. The current classification system is based on a GBDT filter that allows for high-level suppression of CDC hits which, when combined with the CTH trigger information, suppress the overall trigger rate to 13 kHz with only 3.2 μ s latency [15]. COMET will also use a MIDAS-based DAQ system [16] that provides a total throughput of 1 GB/s. 3. COMET StatusAll aspects of COMET are continuously progressing on schedule for Phase- α in 2023 and Phase-I in 2024. At J-PARC, the C-Line of the proton beamline has been completed up to the Hadron Hall where COMET is located. This puts the beamline on track for completion in 2022, ready for Phase- α . The muon transport solenoid, which is already located on site, has had its first cooling and excitation tests recently completed, and preparations for the pion capture solenoid assembly are ongoing. In terms of Phase- α , which will not require the pion capture solenoid to be completed, beam tests for its detectors were also recently performed and analysis is ongoing.The CDC detector, which has been completed since 2016 with readout and testing performed since 2019 [17], was recently moved on site to J-PARC where testing continues in addition to cooling tests on the front end electronics also recently performed. Steady progress has been made on the CRV detector too with the first scintillator module constructed, and full construction is anticipated in 2023. Production of a muon stopping target holder prototype is also underway. The Phase-I version of the StrECAL detector system is also on schedule for completed construction in 2023 with the first straw station out of five completed and the second station well in progress. The ECAL support structure has also been completed with crystal installation and detector construction in progress, and readout electronics production has begun.In terms of COMET’s software updates, the sixth mass production run of simulation data is in progress, which will include the most up-to-date configuration of COMET as we approach Phase-I. Further efforts have also been made to improve the trigger system for Phase-I. The current GBDT-based system has already been shown to meet the trigger rate and latency requirements for Phase-I, but further improvements are currently being explored based on the real-time machine learning techniques discussed in [18]. Trigger schemes for other exotic physics measurements, such as muon to positron conversion, are also being explored. Physics motivations for such measurements can be found in [19].A significant update has also been made to the design of the CTH detector, which has been updated from the previous design discussed in [3]. All counters are now scintillators with the number of scintillator counters per ring increased from 48 to 64 segments. These counters will now be read out by MPPC instead of with photomultiplier tubes, allowing for a reduced cost system with easier replacement during Phase-I data collection. Recent progress on the development of the CTH detector has been made, including photon yield measurements [20], MPPC irradiation plus cooling system tests and preliminary prototype counter beam measurements using 100 MeV electrons at the Australian Synchrotron, as shown in Figure 2. A prototype section of the support structure has also been produced. Future beam tests will be critical for evaluating the positional and angular photon yield dependence of the counters as well as for evaluating the timing resolution. A prototype preamplifier readout system has also been developed to feed timing and energy deposition information from each counter to the trigger system. The CTH detector is expected to be constructed in 2023, ready for Phase-I. 4. ConclusionsThe COMET experiment will search for μ -e conversion in muonic aluminium, reaching the highest experimental sensitivity yet utilising a phased approach. The low-intensity beam run, Phase- α , which is an important milestone for COMET to reach its physics goals is on track to begin in 2023. Phase-I, which expects to reach a single-event sensitivity of 3.1 × 10 − 15 , is also on schedule to begin its physics data collection run in 2024, while Phase-II will begin shortly after, while increasing the single-event sensitivity to 1.4 × 10 − 17 , and R&D efforts are happening concurrently with the construction of Phase-I systems. This proceeding article provides an overview of the COMET experiment and the collaboration’s most recent progress in working towards the physics goals set for each phase.

З. Индутный,"Localized surface plasmon, Diffraction efficiency","In this paper, we study the effect of thin selenium layers up to 3 nm thick on the efficiency of excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The Se layers were deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum on the surface of silver and aluminum gratings. Gratings with a groove profile close to sinusoidal and a period equal to а = 694 nm were formed on chalcogenide photoresist films using interference lithography. Then they were coated with layers of the above metals with a thickness of 80–85 nm using thermal evaporation. Registration of SPP excitation on the gratings was carried out by measuring the angular dependences of the intensity of specularly reflected or diffracted p-polarized He-Ne laser radiation on a stand mounted on the basis of a G5M goniometer and a Fedorov table. An atomic force microscope was used to determine the shape of the groove profile and the depth of the grating relief. It has been found that for silver gratings with a relief modulation depth h/a less than the optimal value (which ensures maximum plasmon absorption, i.e., the maximum efficiency of SPP excitation), selenium deposition causes significant degradation of the plasmon resonance: a decrease in the depth of the minimum of the total reflection Rpt (i.e., a decrease in the efficiency of plasmon absorption), a shift of the Rpt minimum towards larger angles, and its widering. For silver gratings with h/a greater than the optimal value, a similar shift and widering of the plasmon resonance is also observed. However, at the same time, a significant deepening of the Rpt minimum is recorded, that is, an increase in the efficiency of SPP excitation. Such changes in the plasmon characteristics also appear on aluminum gratings, however, in this case the effect of the selenium layers is weaker by an order of magnitude. The obtained results allow us to propose a method of correcting the plasmonic characteristics of silver gratings in which the value of h/a is higher than optimal.",optoelektronìka ta napìvprovìdnikova tehnìka,"['2707-6792', '2707-6806']",journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1572432597', 'https://openalex.org/W1974884021', 'https://openalex.org/W1986387313', 'https://openalex.org/W2000834326', 'https://openalex.org/W2059786612', 'https://openalex.org/W2076562645', 'https://openalex.org/W2083926174', 'https://openalex.org/W2086358390', 'https://openalex.org/W2087068678', 'https://openalex.org/W2091626547', 'https://openalex.org/W2216404643', 'https://openalex.org/W2312558986', 'https://openalex.org/W2559079242', 'https://openalex.org/W2567336200', 'https://openalex.org/W2597620441', 'https://openalex.org/W2737514592', 'https://openalex.org/W2742689927', 'https://openalex.org/W2802011320', 'https://openalex.org/W2909239607', 'https://openalex.org/W2957319591', 'https://openalex.org/W3047265769', 'https://openalex.org/W3083139102', 'https://openalex.org/W3126563946', 'https://openalex.org/W3212009301', 'https://openalex.org/W4200270785', 'https://openalex.org/W4296862', 'https://openalex.org/W4308589339']",Индутный,,False,

Dazu wurden Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) und Ta\(_2\)O\(_5\) mittels Atomlagenabscheidung (atomic layer deposition: ALD) auf polykristallinen Silberoberflachen abgeschieden und deren Wachstum und Haftung analysiert. Zum Vergleich wurden die Edelmetalle Gold und Platin herangezogen. 

Die Beurteilung der Barriereeigenschaften gegenuber Schadgas erfolgte mittels einer Ozon-Behandlung in der ALD-Prozesskammer. Es zeigte sich, dass nur ALD-Schichten, die bis zu eine Abscheidetemperatur von unter 140~°C abgeschieden wurden, eine ausreichende Barrierewirkung liefern konnten. Erklart werden konnte dieses Phanomen durch unterschiedliche Wachtumsregime fur unterschiedliche Abscheidetemperaturen zwischen 100 und 300~°C, die in einer temperaturabhangigen Bedeckung der Silberoberflache resultieren. Wahrend bei niedrigen Temperaturen eine geschlossene Schicht aufwachst, findet ALD-Wachstum bei hoheren Temperaturen, beginnend uber 115~°C, nur an Korngrenzen, Stufenkanten und Defekten statt. Es wurden verschiedene Oberflachenbehandlungen untersucht und nur eine Vorbehandlung mit H\(_2\)O bei 100~°C in der ALD-Prozesskammer konnte auch bei hoheren Temperaturen zu einem geschlossenen Schichtwachstum fuhren.

In-vacuo XPS Untersuchungen der ersten Zyklen des Al\(_2\)O\(_3\)-Wachstums bei 100 und 200~°C auf Silber wurden miteinander und mit einer Silizium Referenzprobe verglichen. Bei beiden Wachstumstemperaturen kam es nicht zur Oxidation von Ag. Ab dem ersten TMA-Puls konnten Al-Verbindungen auf der Oberflache nachgewiesen werden. Es zeigte sich, dass TMA auf der Ag-Oberflache zu Methylaluminium und Methylresten dissoziieren und an Adsorbaten anbinden kann. Zusatzlich zeigte sich ein erhohtes, nicht gesattigtes Wachstumsverhalten bei 200~°C, das uber einen Sauerstoffdiffusionsprozess erklart werden kann. Sauerstoff-Verunreinigungen, die sich in der Silberschicht befinden, konnten uber Korngrenzendiffusion an die Oberflache gelangen und dort mit TMA reagieren. Aufgrund von Oberflachendiffusion bei hoheren Temperaturen gab es eine stabile Adsorption nur an Korngrenzen, Stufenkanten und Defekten. Nur die Si-Oberflache zeigte ein typisches ALD-Wachstum. 

Auf Pt und Au lag unabhangig von weiteren Vorbehandlungen bei allen Beschichtungstemperaturen ein geschlossenes ALD-Anwachsen vor. Damit eignete sich Au gut um die Barriere-Eigenschaften der ALD-Schicht gegen Feuchtigkeit in Abhangigkeit von der Wachstumstemperatur nachzuweisen. Dies wurde mit einer cyanidischen Atzlosung getestet. Wahrend fur eine Barriere gegen Ozon bereits eine dunne geschlossene Schicht, abgeschieden bei 100~°C ausreicht, musste gegen die Atzlosung eine hohere Beschichtungstemperatur verwendet werden. 

Fur die Bewertung der Haftung der Passivierungsschicht wurde neben den ublichen einfachen Tesatest und Schertest, ein pneumatischer Haftungstest entwickelt und eingesetzt. Dafur wurde die Methode des Blistertest angepasst, der ursprunglich fur die Bestimmung der Haftung organischer Schichten, wie beispielsweise Kleber und Lacke, eingesetzt wurde, sodass er sich fur die Untersuchung dunner Schichten eignet. Dazu wurde die zu testende Grenzflache mittels eines Si-Tragers mechanisch unterstutzt. Hierdurch kann die Deformation der Schicht minimiert werden und es kommt stattdessen zu einem Bruch. Die Delamination der Testschicht wurde durch das Anlegen des hydrostatischen Drucks erreicht, was eine gleichmasige Kraftverteilung gewahrleistet. Die Proben liesen sich mittels Standard-Dunnfilmtechnologie herstellen und konnen damit industriell gut eingesetzt werden. Sowohl der Messaufbau als auch die Probenpraparation wurden in dieser Arbeit vorgestellt.

Es wurde mittels der beiden Bondmaterialien AuSn und Indium die maximal bestimmbare Adhasionsspannung evaluiert und dafur Werte von (0,26 \(\pm\) 0,03) \(\cdot 10^9 \) Pa fur AuSn und (0,09 \(\pm\) 0,01) \(\cdot 10^9 \) Pa fur In bestimmt. Da im In bereits bei sehr niedrigen Drucken ein kohasives Versagen auftritt, eignet sich AuSn besser fur die Messung anderer Grenzflachen. Damit wurden schlieslich die Grenzflachen ALD-Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) und ALD-Ta\(_2\)O\(_5\) auf Ag mit H\(_2\)O-Vorbehandlung sowie ALD-Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) auf Pt untersucht. Es wurden die folgenden Adhasionsspannungen erreicht: Fur ALD-Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) auf Ag: (0,23 \(\pm\) 0,01) \(\cdot 10^9 \) Pa, fur ALD-Ta\(_2\)O\(_5\) auf Ag: (0,15 \(\pm\) 0,03) \(\cdot 10^9 \) Pa und fur ALD-Al\(_2\)O\(_3\) auf Pt: (0,20 \(\pm\) 0,01) \(\cdot 10^9 \) Pa. Somit wurde bestatigt, dass mit Hilfe der Vorbehandlung der Ag-Oberflache die ALD-Al\(_2\)O\(_3\)-Schicht nicht nur geschlossen ist, sondern auch ausreichend gut haftet und sich damit hervorragend als Barriere eignet.",,,,0,[],Huppmann,,False,

The epitaxial growth of α-quartz film on SOI (100) substrate starts with the preparation of a strontium doped silica sol-gel and continues with the deposition of this gel into the SOI substrate in a thin film form using the dip-coating technique under atmospheric conditions at room temperature. Before crystallization of the gel film, nanostructuration is performed onto the film surface by nanoimprint lithography (NIL). Epitaxial film growth is reached at 1000 °C, inducing a perfect crystallization of the patterned gel film. Fabrication of quartz crystal cantilever devices is a four-step process based on microfabrication techniques. The process starts with shaping the quartz surface, and then metal deposition for electrodes follows it. After removing the silicone, the cantilever is released from SOI substrate eliminating SiO2 between silicon and quartz. The device performance is analyzed by non-contact laser vibrometer (LDV) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Among the different cantilever's dimensions included in the fabricated chip, the nanostructured cantilever analyzed in this work exhibited a dimension of 40 µm large and 100 µm long and was fabricated with a 600 nm thick patterned quartz layer (nanopillar diameter and separation distance of 400 nm and 1 µm, respectively) epitaxially grown on a 2 µm thick Si device layer. The measured resonance frequency was 267 kHz and the estimated quality factor, Q, of the whole mechanical structure was Q ~ 398 under low vacuum conditions. We observed the voltage-dependent linear displacement of cantilever with both techniques (i.e., AFM contact measurement and LDV). Therefore, proving that these devices can be activated through the indirect piezoelectric effect.",journal of visualized experiments,['1940-087X'],journal,0,[],Jolly,,False,

The surface orientation of adsorbed molecules was determined. The silanes adsorption heats were calculated by different ways. It was shown that silanes are chemisorbed on the aluminium surface.

This layer covalently bonded to the hydroxylsurface groups of the metal. The thickness of the surface nanolayer can be controlled by changing the deposition conditions. The effect of the vinylsiloxanenanolayer on the dissolution of aluminium in chloride-containing solutions has been studied.

The objective of the orthodontists should be to restore the surface of enamel as closely as possible to natural enamel without inducing iatrogenic injury and with minimal loss of enamel structure. Bonding of brackets on enamel involves surface etching, application of primer, and adhesive. All these steps involve the risk of damaging the enamel surface and changing its original morphology. Upon completion of orthodontic treatment, the debonding procedure followed by residual resin removal further damages the enamel, producing scratches, cracks, grooves, removal of fluoride-rich external enamel layer, and increasing the enamel roughness. The rough enamel surface inhibits proper cleaning and thus invites plaque deposition, bacterial retention, stain formation, and thus dampening the aesthetic appearance of the teeth. Restoring the enamel to its original morphology is a challenge. A variety of mechanical methods have been proposed to achieve satisfactory resin removal with least possible enamel damage following bracket debonding. The Enhance finishing and Pogo polishing system (Dentsply, Milford, USA) is also widely used and is made up of polymerized urethane dimethacrylate resin, aluminium oxide, silicon dioxide, and fine diamond powder. Methods: The sample of 50 tooth extracted for orthodontic purpose was procured as per the inclusion criteria. Buccal surfaces of teeth on the area where bracket is bonded and then debonding is done. After residual resin removal with Enhance system finishing and polishing bur. Measurements for each specimen were measured and mean was calculated and evaluated with the help of Atomic Force Microscopy (Baseline roughness data). Result: Self cure composite gives relatively lesser surface roughness when compared to light cure composites. Conclusion: The study shows that the self cure adhesive gives the smoother enamel surface when compared to the tooth treated with light cure adhesive after debonding and finishing and polishing.",kerala dental journal,"['0972-396X', '2950-3795']",journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1520893282', 'https://openalex.org/W1530821867', 'https://openalex.org/W1995797048', 'https://openalex.org/W2077597735', 'https://openalex.org/W2084898350', 'https://openalex.org/W2147907681', 'https://openalex.org/W2227270361', 'https://openalex.org/W2884886365', 'https://openalex.org/W2943416327', 'https://openalex.org/W2952227508', 'https://openalex.org/W4291020034']",Mandolil,,False,

One of the most problematic places is the expired expiration dates of absorber filters used in the filter ventilation systems of civil protection structures. This can lead to a decrease in their protective effect on the disinfection of outdoor air in the conditions of man-made accidents, military operations or terrorist acts. As a result, it poses a threat to the life and health of people. To solve this problem, it is proposed to use catalytic materials based on titanium dioxide, obtained by plasma-electrolyte oxidation, in the filter-ventilation systems of civil protection facilities. In the course of the study, TiO2·MO coatings were formed on model titanium samples, where M is W, Mo, Zr, Zn. Using the methods of energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, and photocolorimetric studies, the properties of the synthesized functional materials were studied and the possibilities of their application in the technology of photocatalytic oxidation of toxic substances were determined. An analysis was also made of possible designs of photocatalytic blocks for filter ventilation systems using catalytic materials based on TiO2. It has been determined that the optimal technological form of a catalyst in a photocatalytic block is the deposition of a layer of titanium dioxide doped with additional components on a structured base by plasma-electrolyte oxidation. The results obtained made it possible to create proposals for the use of synthesized catalytic materials to increase the degree of protection of the population at civil protection facilities. In particular, it is proposed to arrange the existing filter ventilation systems with a photocatalytic unit (module) to increase the efficiency of neutralizing chemically hazardous substances, and, consequently, the degree of protection of people.

Ulbrandt, Xiaozhi Zhang, Yugang Zhang, Karl Ludwig, Mahsa Mokhtarzadeh",,"X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) is being developed as a tool to study nanoscale dynamics of fluctuations during thin film growth and surface patterning. XPCS examines the evolution of the X-ray scattering speckle pattern in reciprocal space to reveal dynamics information not accessible through any other means. Unlike low-coherence conventional X-ray scattering, which incoherently averages over different regions of a sample, coherent X-ray scattering is sensitive to the detailed structure of a given sample at that moment in time. In thin film growth processes, heterodyning, which occurs due to coherent mixing of two scattered signals, can be used to investigate the relationship between surface growth velocity and defect propagation. And, for polycrystalline thin film growth, the spatial coherence of the X-ray beam can substitute for the missing spatial coherence of the growth process to track layered growth in detail, even in a growth regime in which there are no conventional growth oscillations of the X-ray intensity. This has opened the door for detailed dynamics studies of individual atomic layers during real-world growth and patterning, not just in perfect single-crystal growth cases, which greatly expands the applicability of in-situ X-ray scattering methods. Step-flow dynamics in mounded polycrystalline growth has been studied separately for two thin film organic semiconductors deposited by thermal deposition in a vacuum environment, C60 and diindenoperylene (DIP). Highly oriented polycrystalline thin films are readily obtained in both systems, where mounds are composed of crystalline monolayer-height steps and terraces in a so-called wedding cake morphology. The formation of mounds is understood to be due to significant Ehrlich-Schwoebel step edge barriers that inhibit molecules from hopping down from one layer to the one below. The mounds exhibit local step flow, which can be monitored using coherent X-ray scattering. This is made possible due to heterodyning between scattering from the average mounds and the moving steps, which becomes visible in XPCS analysis. The effect of desorption, i.e. re-evaporation of deposited molecules is found to be important for understanding these processes. The impact of this work is to enable testing of models of step dynamics, the shape of mounds, and merging of mounds to form continuous thin films. Highly ordered polycrystalline thin films deposited on inexpensive substrates have applications in thin film solar cells and other organic electronic devices. In a separate set of experiments, speckle analysis during self-organized ion beam nanopatterning reveals memory stretching back to the beginning of patterning in the early stages and enables measurement of the velocity of self-organized patterns across surfaces providing the possibility of stringent new tests of the theory of pattern formation and motion.",,,,0,[],Headrick,,False,

Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction Crystal phase engineering of inorganic materials plays a key role in extending the spectrum of reachable materials and exploring their uncovered physicochemical properties.1–5 In particular, group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs; the transition metals are Mo and W, and the chalcogens are S, Se, and Te) have been extensively studied due to their unique metallic octahedral or distorted octahedral 1T phases (1T structure denotes an octahedral coordination for W atom).6,7 These 1T TMDCs have been reported to exhibit superior performance for catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with their corresponding semiconducting prismatic 2H phases (2H structure denotes a prismatic coordination for W atom), owing to the dramatically reduced charge-transfer resistance and increased active sites of the basal plane.8,9 Previous synthetic approaches mainly focused on solid-state procedures10 or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth,11 whereas the direct wet-chemical protocols are quite rare.12–14 The wet-chemical synthesis methods hold promise for scale-up production and provide a versatile ground for chemical functionalization and hybridization with other materials, but the subtle chemistry and reactivity in solution-phase synthesis (e.g., precursor, surfactant, and temperature) are difficult to control.15,16 Until now, it remains a big challenge to synthesize 1T TMDCs-based nanostructures with high-purity crystal phases and well-controlled sizes and morphologies. Precise control over thre composition, spatial distribution of each domain, and interfaces between different components in hybrid nanostructures (HNs) has become the research focus recently, which facilitates advances in synthesis and assembly methodologies, as well as fundamental insights into the structure–property–function relationships.17–21 However, a systematic design of proper synthetic conditions for fabricating HNs with controlled physical parameters remains challenging. For instance, integrating materials of different dimensionalities (e.g., one-dimensional [1D]/two-dimensional [2D],22,23 2D/1D,24 and 2D/2D25 HNs) can generate high surface area and new electron states, but little progress has been made up till now, considering the limitation of materials choice with appropriate compatibility and the difficulty in combination of different growth modes. Moreover, it is even more challenging to construct the metastable-phase heterostructures because of their thermodynamically unstable nature, especially for 1T TMDCs, which easily undergo phase transition to more stable 2H phases under external disturbance.26 Thus, a general synthetic approach with delicate control over crystal phase and dimensionality in HNs is highly desirable, which will provide a controllable platform for exploring novel, optimized, or enhanced properties. Herein, we report a general solution protocol for phase-controlled synthesis of distorted octahedral 1T WS2-based multidimensional HNs from 2D, 1D, and zero-dimensional (0D) Ni3S4 templates (denoted as 1T WS2-2D/1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs), which is realized by tuning the reactivity of the tungsten precursor and the interaction between crystal surface and ligands. By changing the reaction temperature, the corresponding prismatic 2H WS2-based HNs (denoted as 2H WS2-2D/1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs) can also be achieved. This unique toolbox for the synthesis and formation process of monodispersed, uniform, and phase-controlled multidimensional 1T WS2-2D/1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs is demonstrated in Figure 1. As a proof-of-concept application, the crystal phase- and dimensionality-dependent electrocatalysis is demonstrated by evaluating their HER performances. Remarkably, the 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs exhibit a low overpotential of 109 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and show no evidence of deactivation after long-term operation. Our studies offer new perspectives for designing advanced materials based on crystal phase and dimensionality engineering strategies.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Experimental Methods Materials synthesis Ammonium tetrathiotungstate [(NH4)2WS4] was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, MA). 1,2-Hexadecanediol (HDD, 98%) was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Nickel(II) acetylacetonate [Ni(acac)2] (95%), oleylamine (OAm, 70%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT, 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). NiCl2·6H2O, acetic acid, hexane, and ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used as received without further purification. In a typical procedure, 35 mg (NH4)2WS4 was added into 10 mL OAm in a 25 mL three-neck flask and heated to 120 °C for 20 min under vacuum. Then the flask was purged with N2, and 25 mg Ni(acac)2 dissolved in 5 mL hot OAm was injected. Then the solution was maintained at 150 °C for 30 min (formation of 2D Ni3S4) and slowly heated to 210 °C for 60 min. The mixture was cooled to room temperature. Finally, the obtained product was collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 3 min) and washed several times with hexane and ethanol for further characterization. As for 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs, the reaction temperature was increased to 310 °C. The 1D Ni3S4 and 0D Ni3S4 were synthesized according to reported methods.27 In a typical procedure for 1T WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs, 35 mg (NH4)2WS4 and 10 mg as-synthesized 1D/0D Ni3S4 were added into 10 mL OAm in a 25 mL three-neck flask and heated to 120 °C for 20 min under vacuum. Then the solution was slowly heated to 280 °C for 30 min under N2 atmosphere. Finally, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. As for 2H WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs, the reaction temperature was increased to 340 °C. The 1T and 2H WS2 were synthesized by modification of reported methods.28 In a typical procedure for 1T WS2, 35 mg (NH4)2WS4 was added into 10 mL OAm in a 25 mL three-neck flask and heated to 120 °C for 20 min under vacuum. Then the solution was slowly heated to 280 °C for 30 min under N2 atmosphere. Finally, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. As for 2H WS2, the reaction temperature was increased to 340 °C. Characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed on a SmartLab 9kW (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan)X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromaticized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were employed on HT-7700 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images were carried out on JEM-ARM 200F (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). STEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) analysis were conducted on Talos F200X (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALab 250Xi (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα radiation exciting source. Raman scattering spectra were recorded with a LabRAM HR Evolution (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Paris, France) spectrometer using the 532 nm line. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured on a Nicolet 6700 (Thermo Nicolet, Wisconsin) FT-IR spectrometer. Optical absorption spectra were measured at room temperature using a DUV-3700 UV–vis–near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Electrocatalytic measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature using a rotating disk working electrode made of glassy carbon (GC) (PINE, 5 mm diameter, 0.196 cm2) connected to a Multipotentiostat (IMPex, ZAHNER-Elektrik, Germany). Graphite rod and Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All reported potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) through RHE calibration in 1 M KOH, E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 1.03 V. The preparation method of the working electrodes containing various catalysts can be found as follows. In short, 5 mg of catalyst powder was dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol with 20 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt %; Sigma-Aldrich). Then the mixture was ultrasonicated for ∼30 min to generate a homogeneous ink. Next, 8 µL of the dispersion was transferred onto the GC disk. Finally, the as-prepared catalyst film was dried at room temperature. For comparison, a bare GC electrode that had been polished and cleaned was also dried for electrochemical measurement. Before electrochemical measurements, the electrolyte (1 M KOH) was bubbled with pure Ar for at least 30 min. The polarization curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from −0.8 to 0.2 V versus RHE at room temperature and 1600 rpm with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. All polarization curves arising from the solution resistance were iR-corrected. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed in the same configuration at 250 mV overpotential over a frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz at the amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage of 5 mV. Cyclic voltammograms performed at different sweep rates used to estimate the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) were recorded in the potential region of 0.1–0.2 V versus RHE at room temperature. For the stability evaluation, electrode potential was cycled from −0.3 to 0.2 V versus RHE with a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1. At the end of the cycling experiment, the polarization curve was obtained with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. Chronoamperometry data were collected on various catalyst-coated carbon fiber papers (1 cm2, catalyst loading: 1 mg) at 250 mV overpotential. The polarization curves were replotted as η (η) versus log current (log j) to get Tafel plots. By fitting the linear portion of the Tafel plots to the Tafel equation (η = b log (j) + a), the Tafel slope (b) can be obtained. Density functional theory calculations We performed the density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)29,30 program with the projector augmented wave (PAW)31,32 method. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)33 generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange–correlation functional was used throughout. A 500 eV plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff was chosen, and a 4 × 2 × 1 Monhorst–Pack k-point sampling was adopted for the structure relaxation. The convergence criterion for the electronic self-consistent iteration was set to be 10–4 eV. A residual force threshold of 0.02 eV Å−1 was set for geometry optimizations. The calculations were conducted on (0 0 1) surface of 1T and 2H WS2, and (0 1 1) surface of Ni3S4 slab models. A vacuum layer 15 Å thick was used to ensure the separation between slabs. The key reaction steps in alkaline HER: (1) H 2 O + e − + * → * H + OH − (Volmer step) (2) 2 * H → H 2 (Tafel step) (3) * H + H 2 O + e − → * + O H − + H 2 (Heyrovsky step) Here, * denotes the corresponding surface models. The free energy for steps (1) and (3) should be the same at the equilibrium potential of HER. Under this assumption, one can avoid computation of the exact free energy of OH− in solutions by using computational hydrogen electrodes.34 Herein, four main stages are considered: initial state, activated water adsorption, H* intermediates formation, and H2 desorption.35 The free energies are calculated as: G 0 = G ( * ) + G ( H 2 O ) G 1 = G ( * H − OH ) G 2 = G ( * H ) + G ( OH − ) G 3 = G ( * ) + 1 / 2 G ( H 2 ) + G ( OH − ) And G 0 = G 3 The Gibbs free energy changes are calculated as follows: Δ G 1 = G 1 − G 0 Δ G 2 = G 2 − G 1 Δ G 3 = G 3 − G 2 The free energy was calculated using the equation: G = E + E ZPE − T S Here, E, EZPE, T, and S are the total energy from DFT calculations, zero-point energy (ZPE), temperature (298 K), and the entropy, respectively. ZPE values are calculated from the frequency calculations. The entropic contributions from H2 and H2O molecules are taken from Chemical Rubber Company Press (CRC) Handbook. Results and Discussion Preparation and structural analyses of 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs We achieved the vertical growth of distorted octahedral 1T WS2 nanosheets on 2D Ni3S4 nanoplates (denoted as 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs) through successive thermolysis of Ni(acac)2 and (NH4)2WS4 metal precursors in OAm solution at 210 °C for 1 h. Simply increasing the reaction temperature to 310 °C leads to the formation of corresponding prismatic 2H WS2-based counterparts (denoted as 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs) (see Experimental Methods for details). This is caused by the different reactivity of the precursor and the interaction between crystal surface and ligands: a lower temperature benefits the deactivation of (NH4)2WS4, giving rise to the metastable 1T phase.12 Moreover, 1T-WS2 consists of negatively charged WS2− surfaces that stabilized by positively charged oleylammonium ligands, hence a lower temperature could strengthen their coordination effect, and consequently the stability.36 The low- and high-magnified transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figures 2a and 2b) show uniform 2D/2D hierarchical architectures with the branch length of ∼40 nm, as well as the plate length and thickness of ∼60 and ∼8 nm respectively, inherited well from the original templates ( Supporting Information Figure S1). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Figures 2c and 2d) taken from the white solid squares (1 and 2 in Figure 2b) confirm the structural relationship of the interfaces between two distinct components, indicating the formation of crystalline polydymite Ni3S4 with resolved lattice fringes of (111) and (113) planes on lateral and basal sides, respectively. This analysis agrees with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns ( Supporting Information Figure S2), in which cubic Ni3S4 with spinel structure (JCPDS no. 43-1469) can be observed.37 However, diffraction peaks from WS2 are relatively weak, probably owing to its ultrathin nature (white dotted lines and dotted circles in Figures 2c and 2d). Note that the main peak in the 32° region was observed to shift toward lower angles by ∼1.2°, indicating the formation of the unusual distorted octahedral 1T phase,13 which agrees with the XRD results of the as-synthesized 1T and 2H WS2 nanosheets ( Supporting Information Figure S3). HR-HAADF-STEM images (Figures 2e and 2f) exhibit typical 1T WS2 on Ni3S4 template in achieved 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs according to their zigzag chains of W atoms. By contrast, the 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs show typical 2H WS2 with hexagonal packing crystal structures. Moreover, the corresponding intensity profile analysis (Figure 2g) along the white solid rectangles (3 and 4 in Figures 2e and 2f) reveals the spatial location of W and S atoms, further confirming the formation of 1T and 2H phases.38 These results also match well with the HR-HAADF-STEM analysis of the as-synthesized 1T and 2H WS2 nanosheets ( Supporting Information Figure S4). STEM-EDS elemental mapping images (Figure 2h) of a typical 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HN show W-rich branches and Ni-rich plates with S enrichment in the whole structure. By comparison, the 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs show almost the same size, morphology, crystal phases of Ni3S4, and the distribution of Ni, S, and W elements ( Supporting Information Figure S5). Together, these results support that we have succeeded in phase-controllable synthesizing the new, uniform, and high-purity 1T/2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Preparation and structural analyses of 1T WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs We also achieved the growth of 1T WS2 nanosheets on 1D Ni3S4 nanorods and 0D Ni3S4 nanoparticles (denoted as 1T WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs) by gradual thermolysis of (NH4)2WS4 in OAm solution comprising the presynthesized 1D or 0D Ni3S4 templates ( Supporting Information Figures S6 and S7) at 280 °C for 30 min. Similarly, increasing the reaction temperature to 340 °C leads to the formation of corresponding 2H WS2-based counterparts (denoted as 2H WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs) (see Experimental Methods for details). TEM ( Supporting Information Figure S8) and HAADF-STEM images (Figures 3a and 3b) of 1T WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs show that the length and diameter of the nanorods were ∼40 and ∼10 nm, respectively, and the average length of the nanoparticles was ∼15 nm. HRTEM images demonstrate good crystallinity of a typical polydymite Ni3S4 nanorod and nanoparticle, with resolved lattice fringes of (113) and (022) planes, respectively. The white dotted circles suggest the ultrathin 1T WS2 interfaced with the Ni3S4 component (insets in Figures 3a and 3b). XRD patterns further confirm the diffraction peaks are indexed to the same cubic spinel-structured Ni3S4 (JCPDS no. 43-1469). But the almost negligible diffraction peaks from WS2 in the 32° region result from its low degree of crystallinity ( Supporting Information Figure S9). HR-HAADF-STEM images (Figures 3c and 3d) of 1T WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs exhibit 1T WS2 on both 1D and 0D Ni3S4 templates with zigzag-chained W atom arrangement, whereas 2H WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs display obvious 2H WS2 with uniform crystal structures of hexagonal packing ( Supporting Information Figure S10). Furthermore, the corresponding intensity profile analysis (Figure 3e) along the white solid rectangles (1 and 2 in Figures 3c and 3d) demonstrates the spatial location of W and S atoms, confirming the formation of 1T and 2H phases. STEM-EDS elemental mapping images (Figures 3f and 3g) of 1T WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs show W-rich layers and Ni-rich rods/particles with S enrichment in the whole structure. By comparison, the 2H WS2-1D/0D Ni3S4 HNs also show almost the same size, morphology, crystal phases of Ni3S4, and distribution of Ni, S, and W elements ( Supporting Information Figures S11–S13).

Download figure Download PowerPoint Formation mechanism To gain an insight into the formation mechanism of the 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs, a series of control experiments were performed. The ratio of precursors greatly affects their final morphologies ( Supporting Information Figures S14 and S15). The nucleation and growth of 1T WS2 are controlled through reaction temperature and time. The reaction between 150 and 180 °C quickly enables the Ni precursors to be confined in the soft organic–inorganic intermediates of OAm and tungsten precursors, giving rise to uniform 2D platforms for subsequent growth.39 Increasing reaction temperature to 210 °C leads to the formation and vertical growth of high-density starting nuclei into sheet-like structures via consumption of the tungsten precursors on preformed templates, which yields uniform three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architectures composed of 2D 1T WS2 nanosheets and 2D Ni3S4 nanoplates ( Supporting Information Figure S16), similar to the previous reported 1T MoS2-2D NiS2 structures.40 As for 1T WS2-1D Ni3S4 HNs, the reaction between 220 and 250 °C indicates no sign for the formation of ultrathin sheet-like structures on surfaces of preformed templates. After the reaction temperature is increased to 280 °C, the formation and growth of starting nuclei into sheet-like structures were observed, which yielded uniform ultrathin curled layers composed of 2D 1T WS2 nanosheets and 1D Ni3S4 nanorods ( Supporting Information Figure S17). Crystal structures and characterization of 1T/2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs Figure 4a illustrates the side (up) and top (bottom) views of the atomic crystal structures of 1T/2H WS2-Ni3S4 slab models, where the symmetry differences between the distorted octahedral coordinated 1T WS2 and the prismatic coordinated 2H WS2 (red dotted circles) can be clearly observed. We used XPS to study the chemical states of the 1T/2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs. As shown in Figure 4b, W 4f peaks of 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs were located at 32 eV (4f7/2) and 34.1 eV (4f5/2), which both show a shift of ∼0.9 eV to lower binding energy compared with the 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs. This binding energy shift could be originated from the change in the metal coordination and the slightly increased W–S bond length. Meanwhile, the minor fractions of the 2H phase (32.7 and 34.8 eV) and traces of oxidized tungsten (35.6 and 37.8 eV) exist. We attributed this to the H2O generated from the condensation of OAm reacting with (NH4)2WS4, which might oxidize 1T WS2 or even damage the metastable 1T phase structure. Figure 4c shows that S 2p peaks of 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs were located at 161.4 (2p3/2) and 162.6 eV (2p1/2), which both show a shift of ∼1 eV to lower binding energy compared with the 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs. These W 4f and S 2p results are consistent with the XPS analysis for pure 1T and 2H WS2 ( Supporting Information Figure S18). Moreover, the binding energy of Ni 2p peaks (Figure 4d) for 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs markedly increases by ∼0.7 eV versus the 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs. This chemical shift observed for Ni 2p peaks is remarkable, which is probably due to strong charge transfer from Ni3S4 to 1T WS2 at the nanoscale interfaces.41 Figure 4 | (a) Side and top view atomic crystal structures of typical 1T/2H WS2-Ni3S4 slab models.

Download figure Download PowerPoint Raman spectrum of 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs shows a clearly distinct set of vibration modes of relatively low intensity compared with the 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs (Figure 4e), which could be attributed to the poor interaction of the metallic phase with light. Two main Raman modes at 393.8 (A1g) and 331.4 cm−1 (E2g1) represent the 2H WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs. New peaks at 234.2, 208.9, and 152.4 cm−1 that corresponded to the Ag, J2, and J1 vibration modes of the 1T WS2 were also observed, which matches with the Raman results for pure 1T and 2H WS2 ( Supporting Information Figure S19),9,42 supporting the effectiveness of our method of synthesizing 1T WS2-2D Ni3S4 HNs.

Pereira da Cunha,"Deposition, Oxidizing agent","There is a significant need for sensors capable of detecting gases, such as H2, O2, NOx, SOx within harsh environments encountered in power plants, industrial manufacturing, oil and gas exploration, and aerospace applications. This project successfully demonstrated the use of wireless microwave acoustic sensor technology for the detection of gases (H2 or O2) from ambient temperatures up to 650°C. The work focused on langasite (LGS) based surface acoustic wave resonator (SAWR) sensors as the harsh-environment sensor platform and explored multiple combinations of high-temperature thin films and device structures which were used to increase the sensor platform stability and detection capability at temperatures in the operational range of 150°C to 700°C. Specific material configurations that were investigated include: yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) decorated with Pt nanoparticles, atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3, palladium, and Pt/Al2O3 co-deposited electrode alloys. Through the deposition of YSZ at temperatures as high as 850°C and the use of graded alloy concentrations of Pt in the fabrication of the Pt/Al2O3 electrode structures, film stress problems were mitigated, and sensor operation and stability achieved. To test and evaluate SAWR sensor performance for the detection of H2 and O2 under the influence of temperature variations, a comprehensive gas sensor control system and test apparatus was created to operate within a laboratory box furnace-controlled environment. In addition to the advancement in thin film materials through the deposition and fabrication techniques mentioned above, the work characterized the performance of sensors containing these films in the presence of oxidizing and reducing gases between 25°C and 700°C. In particular, the work revealed that the exposure of the SAWR sensor surfaces to oxidizing environments significantly improve the sensor response to H2, whereas the exposure of the sensor to reducing environments at high temperatures (≈ 500°C) renders the sensor irresponsive to H2, requiring sensor surface treatment at high temperatures (above 500°C) to recover the responsiveness to H2. The SAWR sensors have been also tested for wireless operation and array operation using multiple orientations to resolve the detection of gases under temperature variations. The work developed at the University of Maine was aided by a collaboration with the NETL Research and Innovation Center, Pittsburgh, PA, where thin film materials and device structures fabricated at UMaine were tested and characterized using NETL gas reactors and surface analysis techniques. SAWR sensors fabricated at UMaine were exposed multiple times to temperatures up to 700°C and H2 concentrations up to 100% in the NETL facilities to measure the sensor performance. Environetix Technologies Corporation, a UMaine harsh-environment sensor spin-off company, also provided support and assistance in sensor system testing and implementation. The sensor small size and configuration allows flexible sensor placement and embedding of multiple sensor arrays into a variety of components within power systems and other aerospace or industrial settings that need to be interrogated wirelessly. The SAW platform is an attractive option for high-temperature harsh-environment gas sensing applications due to its inherent features, namely small size, capability of battery-free and wireless operation, and cost effective scale production using well-established production techniques from the semiconductor industry. The research findings achieved in this work, particularly advances regarding the fabrication and performance of the SAWR gas sensor platform, can be adapted and transferred to industrial power plants and other harsh environments.",,,,0,[],Cunha,,False,
1844,1864,https://openalex.org/W3002729788,10.2172/1581765,hot electron scaling and energy coupling in nonlinear laser plasma interactions,report,2020-01-05,2020,,,,,F. N. Beg,Hot electron,"Energy conversion from high power lasers to energetic hot electrons is a fundamental phenomenon in laser-plasma interactions. At laser intensities above a few times 1014 W/cm2, nonlinear laser-plasma interactions lead to the generation of hot electrons with a broad energy distribution at typical temperatures of 10's – 100's kilo-electron-volt (keV). The fraction of laser energy transferred to hot electrons, their energy distribution and energy coupling efficiency to the targets are strongly affected by the laser intensity, wavelength and the plasma condition. Most investigations to date that are related to the fusion of high-energy-density laboratory plasmas (HEDLP) are carried out with relatively moderate laser intensity and lower laser wavelength to minimize hot electron generation, as electron preheating can degrade the fuel assembly. An alternative fusion scheme known as shock ignition (SI) has been proposed, requiring a high intensity spike pulse at the end of a fuel assembly phase to generate a strong shock to ignite the fuel. An initial shock pressure of 0.3 Gbar is required for ignition-scale targets using the SI scheme, requiring a relatively high on-target laser intensity of 5-10X1015 W/cm2 for the spike pulse. At such intensities, copious hot electrons can be produced by laser-plasma-instabilities (LPI), e.g., Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) and Two-Plasmon Decay (TPD). While very energetic electrons (>200 keV) could preheat the fuel, electrons with moderate energies may actually be beneficial for the SI scheme. Electrons in the 50-100 keV range can be stopped in the compressed high-density outer ablator layer leading to an increase in the ignitor shock strength and therefore enhancing overall efficiency in the SI scheme. Considering this importance of total energy and temperature of hot electrons, it is necessary to understand the LPI in the SI high intensity regime. Characterizing the hot electron source and energy coupling is key to investigating the viability of the SI concept. The overall goal of the HEDLP award was to perform a detailed study of the scaling of hot electron generation and energy coupling on high power laser systems, with intensity, wavelength, and target ablator material relevant to the nonlinear laser-plasma interaction at SI relevant conditions.

Drogan, Victoria E. Burlakova","Hexanoic acid, Brass, Metal working, Lubricity","Introduction. The paper considers the evolution of friction coefficient of the pair of copper - steel alloy under friction in a hexanoic acid solution in various concentrations, and antiwear properties of the steel-steel friction pair in an oil-acidic medium. The work objective is to explore the effect of hexanoic acid additives on the tribological characteristics of friction pairs under the friction interaction in waterborne and paraffin-based formulations. Materials and Methods. Tribological studies of a brass-steel friction pair were carried out on the AE-5 end-type friction machine. Antiwear characteristics were explored on a four-ball friction machine (FBW) in accordance with the standard GOST 9490–75. When tested at the FBW, the objective parameters of the lubricity of the oiling compositions were: welding load (Рс); wear spot diameter (Dн), critical load (Рк). Roughness parameters of the servovite film were determined through the optical profilometry; its microgeometry and structure at the nanoscale – through the atomic force microscopy. Research Results. Tribological properties of the brass-steel tribocoupling in aqueous media and steel-steel one in petroleum paraffin-based media are studied. The dependence of the frictional characteristics of the brass-steel friction pair on the concentration of carboxylic acid is established. Its optimum concentration is specified, which provides the effect of wearlessness. A decrease in surface roughness is revealed as a result of the frictional interaction of a brass-steel friction pair in the hexanoic acid solution compared to the initial friction surface due to the formation of a sufficiently dense layer from fine-grained copper clusters with tight particle-size dispersion. The tribological characteristics of a steel-steel friction pair were found to depend on the composition of the lubricant. It is shown that the dependence of the size of the wear scar diameter (WSD) on the acid content in the base oil is nonmonotonic in nature with a pronounced minimum at a concentration of 0.1 mass. %. The critical load (Pк) at a content of 0.05 and 0.1 mass. % increases by 32%, welding load (Pc) - by 27%. Discussion and Conclusions . As a result of the tribological studies of a brass-steel friction pair in the hexanoic acid solution, it has been found that the optimum acid molar concentration in the lubricant composition is 0.1 mol/L. Under the frictional interaction of a brass-steel pair in the hexanoic acid solution, an antifriction copper film is formed on the friction surfaces, which contributes to a sharp decrease in the friction coefficient to 0.007 and metal wear of the friction pair to 25 times. As a result of the frictional interaction of a brasssteel friction pair in the hexanoic acid solution, a decrease in roughness is revealed compared to the initial friction surface. It is found that the frictional interaction of a brass-steel pair in the hexanoic acid solution causes a significant modification of the friction surface as a result of the deposition of finely dispersed copper clusters occurring in the lubricating medium composition and forming a servovite film. As a result of studies, it is found that the dependence of the WSD size on the acid content in the base oil is nonmonotonic in nature with a significant minimum at a concentration of 0.1 mass. %. It is shown that the addition of 0.1 mass. % of hexanoic acid into the lubricant composition exhibits the smallest wear of the steel-steel tribological pair, the WSD decreases to 0.497 mm, the critical load (Pк) and the welding load (Pc) increase by 32% and 27%, respectively.",advanced engineering research,"['1992-5980', '1992-6006']",journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1988992033', 'https://openalex.org/W1992466646', 'https://openalex.org/W2082918235', 'https://openalex.org/W2085554530', 'https://openalex.org/W2092442436', 'https://openalex.org/W2113740672', 'https://openalex.org/W2243256337', 'https://openalex.org/W2318968750', 'https://openalex.org/W2772528414', 'https://openalex.org/W2784255255', 'https://openalex.org/W2915848553', 'https://openalex.org/W2918583885', 'https://openalex.org/W2921855366', 'https://openalex.org/W2943125641', 'https://openalex.org/W4231910933', 'https://openalex.org/W4239306251']",Drogan,,False,

The exceptional properties of MHPs derive from their hybrid organic-inorganic nature, which allows also for low-cost and straightforward processing. Solar cells containing MHPs as absorbing layer have already achieved a power conversion efficiency of about 25,7 %, close to the efficiency of silicon-based devices. Nevertheless, a major limitation, still preventing the uptake of the technology, is related to the reduced stability of these materials when exposed to operative conditions, namely temperature, light, and moisture. Herein, an effective defect passivation of MHP surfaces is a key strategy to tackle both the stability and the enhancement of solar cell performances. Although many solution-based approaches 1 have been tested, we propose here an innovative use of plasma, as a solvent-free, scalable, and non-invasive promising strategy to boost MHP solar cells performances 2. As benchmark material we used Methylammonium Lead Iodide perovskite; thus we have exposed the surface of polycrystalline thin films made of this material to different plasma conditions implying the variation of power, gas, and treatment time, both for low-pressure (LP) and atmospheric pressure plasmas (APPs). The impact of Ar, N2, H2 and O2 LPPs on MAPbI3 optochemical properties and morphology was correlated to the performance of the photovoltaic devices and rationalized by density functional theory calculations3. An interesting improvement in photoluminescence was observed for the Ar and H2 treated films, while an improvement in PCE was observed only for the Ar treated device. This result was ascribed to the efficient removal of the superficial organic component, revealed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), following suitable surface passivation by the electron transporting layer deposition. APP treatments, fed with He gas, were tested on the surface of MAPbI3, too. A milder morphological modification than LPP treatments was observed in this case, but withstanding good surface passivation, as confirmed through the improved photoluminescence intensity, while the effect in terms of photovoltaic devices is still under investigations. Moreover, starting from these encouraging results, new plasma surface processes are now object of evaluation, such as the plasma-deposition of thiophene-like films and the study of LPP treatments applied to tin-based perovskite solar cells, approaches which already show the great versatility and potential of plasma-based techniques.

Tiny droplets on nano- and pico-liter scales exhibit unique physical and chemical properties and play a key role in many applications, including high-resolution printing, hollow material fabrication, microreactors, and drug delivery/sustained release.1-4 Developing efficient and controllable approaches for mass production of tiny droplets with the desired size range is of great interest to researchers in various fields. Present technologies for generating tiny droplets include two major types: micro-orifice-based methods and micro-orifice-free methods.5 The former type of methods, for instance, piezo-driven injection and inkjet printing, usually generate tiny droplets by squeezing liquids through ultra-fine nozzles/tips/channels. Such micro-orifice-based methods usually have high efficiency and controllability yet face challenges, such as micro-orifice clogging and damage. Instead of employing nozzles or tips, the micro-orifice-free methods (e.g., pyroelectrodynamic shooting) ingeniously use the wetting behavior and hydrodynamic properties of liquids to dispense tiny droplets.6, 7 Such methods avoid the problems induced by micro-orifices but suffer from small throughputs and complex operations. It is worth noting that dispensing tiny droplets is energetically unfavorable due to the significantly increased liquid surface area. Thus, both micro-orifice-based methods and micro-orifice-free methods require significant input of external energy (e.g., high pressure, elevated temperature) and cumbersome devices/platforms to successfully produce tiny droplets, which inhibits the application of these methods in confined spaces (i.e., portable/wearable devices) and biological processes. Recently, Xu and co-workers reported a simple method for generating nano-/pico-droplets via reversible superwetting transition, in which a large oil droplet (most water-insoluble liquids) can be dispensed into tiny droplets under the control of an external electric source.8 Briefly, the authors designed a simple yet ingenious cell system that had a porous textured Cu fiber as the working electrode and SnSO4/H2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. This cell realized reversible and quick surface wettability transition of the Cu fiber via the electrochemical method. As a result of the wettability switch, the macro-oil droplet resting on the Cu fiber could automatically complete the wetting–dispensing process driven by surface tension. This tiny droplet-producing method involves two key steps: (1) When a negative potential is applied to the Cu fiber, the superoleophobic Cu fiber becomes superoleophilic as the result of Sn electrodeposition (cathode reaction, Sn2+ + 2e− → Sn), and consequently, the macro-oil droplet resting on the Cu fiber forms a thin oil film within several seconds; (2) on terminating the external electric potential, the Cu fiber becomes superoleophobic with dissolving the Sn deposition layer (Sn + 2H+ → Sn2+ + H2 ↑) in the electrolyte solution, and the oil film retracts to recover its sphere shape. The oil film could be torn during retraction due to the domain-limiting effect of porous surface textures on Cu fiber, forming many tiny oil droplets. With the surrounding aqueous solution fully wetting the Cu fiber, tiny oil droplets were squeezed out of porous structures and released. The whole process can be completed within 1 min and is suitable for continuous production. This tiny droplet-producing method has four notable advantages over conventional technologies. First, this method can be applied to different liquids that are immiscible with water, especially oily liquids with low surface tension, so, it has promising applications in different areas. Second, the two steps involved in tiny droplet generation (i.e., wetting and dispensing processes) are both energetically favorable and can occur spontaneously, which lowers the requirements on energy supply and platforms and enables this method to be incorporated in portable devices. Third, this method can easily produce droplets with the volume varying from microliter to picoliter, by adjusting the porous structure of Cu fiber and magnitude and duration of external electric potential. Such a wide size range of tiny droplets can meet the needs of most applications. Additionally, this method has good stability, a long lifetime, and a low requirement for maintenance, and it can more easily avoid fouling, plogging, and damage issues as compared to the conventional methods. This work provides not only a cell system but also a useful strategy for producing tiny droplets. Different materials, including conductive solids and electrolytes, can be easily applied as substitutes for Cu fiber and SnSO4 in the cell, forming new cell systems (e.g., Cu/Pb, Au/Sn) to meet the needs of various practical applications.9 Considering the simple structures, the cell systems for generating tiny droplets can be readily miniaturized and incorporated into other devices. For instance, this strategy can be potentially incorporated in microneedle patches and used to achieve drug delivery and drug sustained release. This strategy can also be incorporated into lab-on-a-chip devices for quick disease diagnoses, health state monitoring, and chemistry synthesis/analysis. The wetting-dispensing process in this strategy may also be used to separate/detect immiscible liquid contaminants in aqueous solutions. From the perspective of collide and interface science, this reversible superwetting transition method for producing tiny droplets is essentially driven by the intermolecular and surface interactions involved in the water–oil–Cu fiber system.10-13 Specifically, when a macro oil droplet approaches and wets the oleophilic Cu fiber (with Sn deposition) in the aqueous solution, Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek forces, which include Van der Waals (VDW) and electrical double layer (EDL) interactions, together with other interactions such as hydrophobic and hydrodynamic interactions, drive this process as shown in Figure 1a. In contrast, when water molecules/droplets approach and wet the oleophobic Cu fiber surface across the oil film, EDL interaction generally is not present, and VDW, hydrogen bonding, and hydrodynamic interactions play the dominant role (Figure 1b). Additionally, long-range ""hydrophilic"" attraction between water drops and hydrophilic surfaces in oil media, which was reported by us previously, may also contribute to the dispensing process.14 These intermolecular and surfaces interactions, as well as the dynamic interaction processes, can be directly quantified using nanomechanical technologies such as drop/bubble probe atomic force microscopy and surface forces apparatus.10-13 The advances in fabrication methods/devices and fundamental understanding of relevant molecular/surface interaction mechanisms will enable precise modulation of the interaction behaviors among liquid droplets and various solid substrates, with useful implications for the development of novel materials with antifouling and self-cleaning properties.

According to High Precision Devices, its cryogen-free model 125 probe station can test silicon chips at 4 K. It does so by combining the benefits of low-vibration, liquid-helium dip probes and cryogen-free systems that rarely achieve such low temperatures when used alone. When using electrical probes to test chip samples, it is important to reduce vibration levels between the probe and the device under test. The model 125 does that by mechanically isolating the experimental space and insulating it from the cryocooler’s impulses. The probe station can be configured to host either individual chips or whole wafers. Other options include translations up to the full diameter of the wafer, window shutters, coaxial cables, and sample magnets. Its low vibration level makes the model 125 suitable for scanning probe microscopy research, including SQUID studies and atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopy, and for superconducting logic functions, metrology, and quantum sensing and communication.

Goodfellow now offers a new range of perovskites, a group of materials that, according to the company, demonstrate excellent potential for optoelectronic applications. Many perovskites occur as oxides (ABO3), where A and B are typically metal cations. Due to their lattice structures, those materials are characterized by properties such as superconductivity, magnetoresistance, piezoelectricity, and dielectric and pyroelectric behavior. They are therefore good candidates for multilayer capacitors, including fuel cells, solar cells, sensors, and electric batteries. They may also be suitable for use in next-generation display screens, LEDs, memory devices such as RAM, and high-temperature superconductors.

Indium has expanded its portfolio of precision preforms with an ultrathin gold–tin layer designed for semiconductor-laser manufacturing where thermal management has become a challenge. According to the company, the AuLTRA ThInFORMS, which are just 8.89 μm thick, improve the overall operational efficiency of high-output lasers by helping to combat common issues such as poor thermal transfer and shorting. The ultrathin preform reduces bond-line thickness and thus improves thermal transfer and increases the longevity and performance of the device. Reduced solder volume inhibits wicking up the die and minimizes the risk of shorting.

With the UL3000 Fab Ultra, the company has refined the detector to adhere to the special requirements of equipment used to manufacture semiconductor chips, solar cells, and flat-panel displays; of glass and plastic foil coating; and of vacuum process equipment. The UL3000 Fab Ultra is slim, mobile, robust, and intuitive to operate. It uses the vacuum method with helium as the tracer gas in order to safely detect the smallest leaks. A high-performance, low-maintenance roots pump replaces the scroll pump used in previous models. The efficient roughing pump allows the UL3000 Fab Ultra to more quickly evacuate production equipment being tested—especially when it is very large—and thereby reduce downtime in facilities. The detector can identify leak rates of down to 5 × 10−12 mbar∙l/s when testing the vacuum in wafer chambers.

High linear energy transfer (LET) radiations induce more DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) per unit dose than low-LET radiations, potentially enhancing immunogenic effects. This work explores the in vitro dose response characteristics of pro-immunogenic interferon-beta (IFNβ) and cGAS-STING antagonist three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) from varying-LET radiations.Methods: IFNβ and TREX1 expression were measured in MCC13 cells irradiated with graded doses of x-rays or fast neutrons (comparable LET to carbon-12) via ELISA, immunofluorescence, and qPCR assays. Laboratory measurement of the RBE for IFNβ production (RBEIFNβ) and TREX1 upregulation (RBETREX1) was compared to the modeled RBE for DSB induction (RBEDSB) from Monte Carlo DNA damage simulations. RBEIFNβ models were applied to radiation transport simulations to quantify the potential secretion of IFNβ from representative proton, helium-4, and carbon-12 beams.Results: Maximum IFNβ secretions occurred at 5.7 Gy and 14.0 Gy for neutrons and x-rays, respectively (RBEIFNβ of 2.5). TREX1 signal increased linearly, with a four-fold higher upregulation per unit dose for fast neutrons (RBETREX1 of 4.0). Monte Carlo modeling suggests an enhanced Bragg peak-to-entrance ratio for IFNb production in charged particle beams.Conclusion: High-LET radiation initiates larger IFNb and TREX1 responses per unit dose than low-LET radiations. RBEIFNβ is comparable to published values for RBE DSB, whereas RBETREX1 is roughly twofold higher. Therapeutic advantages of high-LET versus low-LET radiation remain unclear. Potential TREX1-targeted interventions may enable IFNb-mediated immunogenic responses at lower doses of high-LET radiations.Aim: To implement lattice radiotherapy using proton pencil beam scanning, and demonstrate treatments that are spatially fractionated in physical dose (PD), with significant escalation of biologic dose (BD) and dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) in the vicinity of the high PD regions.Method: For 5 patients with bulky tumors, spatial proton dose fractionation inside the GTV was achieved using proton lattice radiotherapy (pLRT). This involves a 3D lattice of 1.5-cm diameter spherical dose regions separated by 3 cm on average. pLRT plans were created with Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems). Two fields with an opening angle of at least 40 degrees were used to reduce skin dose at entrance. Dose valleys between spheres were kept below 40% of the peak PD. The resulting LETd distributions were calculated with an in-house GPU-based Monte Carlo simulation. BD was estimated from LETd and PD by using published formulae that are based on the linear-quadratic model, as well as a simpler model that assumes a linear relationship between BD and the product of LETd (in keV/μm) and PD: BD=1.1PD(0.08LETd+0.88).Results: Within the high dose spheres, peak BD values in excess of 140% of the prescription dose were observed (see figures). LETd values in the spheres reached values greater than 4 keV/μm. This was achieved without using any explicit LETd optimization technique, and is a direct consequence of end-of-range energy deposition within the spheres.Conclusion: Besides spatial fractionation, a feature of pLRT is BD escalation. This can be advantageous for debulking radioresistant or hypoxic tumors.Background: This study investigates the radiosensitizing effect of Ganetespib for proton irradiation at a proximal and distal position in a SOBP in comparison to photon irradiation. Rad51, a key protein of homologous recombination repair (HRR), is downregulated by HSP90-inhibiting Ganetespib which provides a promising rational for a specifically proton-sensitizing approach.Methods and Materials: A549 and FaDu cells were treated with low-dose Ganetespib and irradiated with 200kV photons respectively protons at a proximal, low linear energy transfer (LET, 2.1keV/μm) and a distal, higher LET (4.5keV/μm) position within a SOBP. Cellular survival was determined by clonogenic assay, cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry, Rad51 protein levels by western blotting and γH2AX foci by immunofluorescence microscopy.Results: Ganetespib reduced clonogenicity in both cancer cell lines exclusively in response to proton irradiation of both investigated LETs. Upon proton irradiation, a more pronounced accumulation of cells in S/G2/M phase became evident with Ganetespib reducing this population. Rad51 protein levels were more extensively and more persistently elevated in proton- than in photon-irradiated cells and suppressed by Ganetespib at each investigated time point. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a similar induction and removal of γH2AX foci independent of Ganetespib which suggests compensation by more error-prone Rad51-independent repair pathways.Conclusion: Low-dosed Ganetespib significantly sensitizes cancer cells for proximal and distal SOBP proton irradiation. Ganetespib downregulates Rad51 protein and reduces the S/G2/M fraction of cells and is thus considered to suppress HRR. Hence, this study supports pursuing research on the combination of Ganetespib with proton radiotherapy for a prospective clinical exploitation.Purpose: The normal tissue sparing effects of ultra-high dose rate radiation (FLASH) remain poorly understood. We present preliminary results of mouse FLASH proton radiation from a low-energy proton system (50 MeV) optimized for small animal radiobiological research.Methods: We radiated 6-7 week old female C57BL/6 mice with whole lung radiation using the plateau region of a cyclotron-generated 50 MeV preclinical proton beam, transmitting through the whole mouse lung, with beam-shaping via customized vertical and horizontal collimators. Mice were stratified into 3 groups: 1) control/sham radiation; 2) conventional dose rate (17Gy at ∼0.5Gy/sec); and 3) FLASH (16-18Gy at 42-70Gy/sec). Mice were observed for dermatitis. Lung tissue was harvested post-radiation (1-hour, 5-days, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months). H&amp;E and immunohistochemistry was performed for: yH2aX, cleaved caspase-3, and trichrome.Results: Radiation dermatitis was different between FLASH and conventional groups: FLASH (grade 0-1=∼90%, grade 2=∼10%); conventional (grade 0-1=∼40%; grade 2-3=∼60%) [Figure 1]. One-hour post radiation, lower cleaved caspase-3 IHC staining was seen in the FLASH group versus conventional group, while yH2aX staining was similar in both groups [Figure 2]. More lung airspace disease (fluid and inflammatory cells) was seen in the conventional group at 6-months.Conclusion: Preliminary results of mouse FLASH proton radiation from a 50 MeV beam suggest FLASH proton radiation leads to less normal tissue toxicity than conventional dose rate radiation. More studies are ongoing.Introduction: Ultrahigh dose rate (FLASH) proton therapy has the potential to better spare healthy tissues than proton therapy delivered at conventional dose rates. To safely test FLASH in clinical trials, many radiobiological and technological questions must be answered. Therefore, there is a need for an accessible and versatile R&amp;D beam line to conduct FLASH experiments.Experimental setup: The HollandPTC R&amp;D room is equipped with a fixed horizontal beam line providing beam from 70 up to 240 MeV, and intensities from 1 to 800 nA. The room can provide single pencil beam and large fields with 98% beam uniformity and Spread-Out-Bragg Peak (SOBP) produced with 2D passive modulators. Recently, the maximum energy of 250MeV has been released in the R&amp;D room for FLASH applications. The full beam characterisation has been performed together with absolute dose measurements.Results: A 43% transmission efficiency of the ProBeam cyclotron is achieved at a 250 MeV energy. This resulted in a current of around 300 nA at target position. The beam spot size has a standard deviation of 3.6 mm. The fluence rate was found to be 8e6 protons/cm2s, more than a factor of 100 with respect to conventional beams. To further characterise the 250 MeV proton beam at maximum beam current a specific integral monitor chamber is currently under commissioning in collaboration with the company DE.TEC.TOR. Different cutting-edge solutions are adopted for the ionisation chambers to cope with FLASH intensities and minimise the recombination effects.The device is also equipped with X-Y strip ionisation chambers to measure beam size and position.Purpose: To compare out-of-field dosimetry in proton, neutron, and photon radiotherapy with a 3D printed anthropomorphic phantom created using a non-ionizing surface scan.Methods: We used a 3D printed phantom and tissue-equivalent chamber to measure absorbed dose in a phantom constructed from surface imaging of a female volunteer. Absorbed dose was measured in locations approximating the isocenter, thyroid, pacemaker, esophagus, and fetus positions. Square intracranial fields ranging from 2.8cm2 to 12.8cm2 were delivered using 6 MV flattened and flattening-filter-free (FFF) photon therapy, magnetically scanned layered proton therapy, and 50.5 MeV proton generated fast neutron therapy.Results: Among the radiotherapy modalities, proton therapy generated the smallest out-of-field absorbed dose. For both proton and photon therapy, locations far from the field edge absorbed dose was small but measurable with the exception of the esophagus and fetus positions in proton therapy for which the measured dose was not distinguishable from background. Compared to proton therapy, out-of-field dose produced by the 6 MV FFF photon therapy was 60% higher in the thyroid and 30% higher in the pacemaker. Out-of-field dose generated by FFF photon therapy produced less out-of-field dose than conventional photon fields. Out-of-field dose in neutron therapy was highest in all locations.Conclusion: Our measurements demonstrated that out-of-field absorbed dose is reduced in magnetically scanned proton therapy more than photon therapy and is largest in neutron radiotherapy. In each modality distance from the field edge influenced the magnitude of the out-of-field absorbed dose.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of range uncertainty in conjunction with setup errors on dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) distribution in robustly optimized pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton lung plans. Additionally, the variability of LETd distribution in different breathing phases of 4DCT data set was evaluated.Methods: In this study, we utilized the 4DCT data set of an anonymized lung patient. The tumor motion was approximately 6 mm. A PBS lung plan was generated in RayStation using a robust optimization technique (range uncertainty: ±3.5% and setup errors: ±5 mm) on the CTV for a total dose of 7000 cGy(RBE) in 35 fractions. The average RBE was 1.1. The LETd distributions were calculated for the nominal plan, 12 plan robustness scenarios (range uncertainty (±3.5%) in conjunction with setup errors (±5 mm)), and ten different breathing phases of 4DCT data set.Results: For a nominal plan, the mean LETd was— CTV: 2.22 keV/μm; heart: 5.94 keV/μm; normal lung: 3.40 keV/μm. For plan robustness scenarios, the mean LETd was— CTV:2.26±0.22 keV/μm; heart: 5.88±0.50 keV/μm; normal lung: 3.40±0.28 keV/μm. For 10 breathing phases, the mean LETd was— CTV: 2.22±0.04 keV/μm, heart: 5.89±0.17 keV/μm, and normal lung: 3.37±0.13 keV/μm.Conclusion: The maximum difference in mean LETd among plan robustness scenarios was higher than the one from ten different breathing phases. For our 4DCT data set, breathing motion has little effect on LETd distribution in the CTV and organs at risk for PBS plan robustly optimized for the setup and range errors.Introduction: High-risk prostate cancer requires irradiation of both prostate and pelvic lymph-nodes. The inter- and intra-fraction prostate motion poses challenges for treating both targets. An image guidance surveillance program was implemented to evaluate the magnitudes of both inter- and intrafraction motion to identify adaptive replanning needs and to mitigate the impact of systematic errors during treatment.Materials and Method: A total of 85 patients (all with implanted gold markers in the prostate) treated between January 2019 to January 2021 were selected for this study. Daily marker-based target alignment was performed for each patient. The relative position difference between marker and bony alignment were recorded and compared to the PTV margins of the pelvic-nodes. Patients with consistent prostate motion close to or exceeding pelvic node PTV margin expansion were identified and re-simulated/re-planned to mitigate the impact of systematic errors from interfraction prostate motion. Post-treatment orthogonal radiographs were also obtained to evaluate prostate intrafraction motion. Patients with intrafraction motion exceeds the prostate PTV margins were identified and replanned with larger PTV expansion.Results: A total of 4 patients were identified for large systematic errors in interfraction prostate motion (Figure 1). After patients were re-CT simulated and replanned, the interfraction prostate motion error was largely removed. Four different patients were identified due to off-margin intrafraction motion magnitude (Figure 2) and were replanned with larger prostate PTV margins.Conclusion: The IGRT surveillance program was implemented and identified 4 patients for re-simulation and re-planning due to large systematic interfraction prostate motion error; identified 4 different patients for re-planning due to large intrafraction error.Aim: Proton therapy (PT) is still a limited resource mainly because current facilities are bulky and costly. We explore the potential of a new design for PT which may facilitate proton treatments in conventional bunkers and allow the widespread use of protons.Methods: The treatment room consists of a Linac, a motorized couch for treatments in lying position, and a horizontal proton beamline equipped with beam scanning. When proton plans are suboptimal due to limitations in the beam directions, high-quality treatment plans may be obtained by delivering protons and photons in the same fraction. We demonstrate this concept for a nasopharyngeal cancer case. Treatment planning is performed by simultaneously optimizing IMRT and IMPT plans based on their cumulative physical dose. Stochastic optimization is applied to mitigate systematic setup and proton range uncertainties.Results: The combined treatment uses photons to improve dose conformity while protons allow reducing the integral dose in normal tissues (Figure 1). The combined treatment improves on single-modality IMRT and IMPT plans for the main organs at risk (Figure 2a). The lower doses that can be obtained with combined treatment translate into a 10%, 6%, and 4% lower risk for oral mucositis, xerostomia, and dysphagia compared to the pure IMRT plan in the nominal scenario. Stochastic optimization yields robust plans although protons and photons deliver inhomogeneous dose contributions (Figure 2b).Conclusions: Compact and affordable PT systems will likely include a fixed beamline rather than a gantry. When proton-only plans are suboptimal, proton-photon combinations may retain high treatment quality.Background: This work describes our treatment planning strategies to reduce the effect of range and dose calculation uncertainties in the proton therapy plans for targets in the spine with high Z material implants.Method and Materials: Treatment planning was carried out with Eclipse TPS from Varian Medical Systems. The CT numbers of the high Z-material and artifacts were overridden to the values corresponding to the proton RSP of the material and to surrounding tissue respectively. A posterior and two posterior oblique passively scattered proton fields were used to minimize the effect of dose calculation and range uncertainties. The accuracy of dose calculation in Eclipse was evaluated by recalculating the dose using Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS). The robustness of target coverage under 5 to 10 % range uncertainties was evaluated to ensure acceptable target coverage and sparing of organ at risk under worst case scenarios.Results: The use of three fields was found to reduce the effect of range uncertainties and produces a more homogeneous dose distribution compared to that for single PA field. The 3D Max dose difference between calculated dose distributions from Eclipse and MCS for three field plans was found to be 4.1%.Conclusions: Use of three fields is found to produce a proton therapy plan with acceptable dose distributions under dose calculation and range uncertainties. Even with the larger uncertainness due to the presence of high-Z material, the proton therapy plan was preferred over the photon plan due to normal tissue sparing.Purpose: To evaluate the knowledge-based model in prostate proton treatment planning.Methods: The knowledge-based RapidPlan module in Varian Eclipse TPS (v16.1) was used for prostate proton treatment planning. A model was created and trained using 40 patients for a prescription of 70.2 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicle in 26 fractions. The model was evaluated by analyzing the goodness-of-fit summary statistics and identifying possible outliers. The established model was then tested on five additional prostate patients. The model-generated plans were compared to clinical-used plans to determine the accuracy and performance of the model in target coverage and organs-at-risk (OAR) sparing.Results: The chi-squared values of the Rapidplan training result were 1.077, 1.127, 1.208, 1.119 for bladder, left femur, right femur, and rectum, respectively. The average optimization time is less than 10 minutes in a single run. CTV D99% was &gt;99% for all RapidPlans. OAR sparing was superior with RapidPlan ΔDMean= -1.12 Gy (bladder, 13.07 Gy vs. 14.20 Gy), ΔV32 = -0.61% (bladder, 19.07% vs. 19.67%), ΔDMax = -7.50 Gy (Left femur, 22.6 Gy vs. 30.14 Gy), ΔDMax = -7.8 Gy (Right femur, 22.43Gy vs. 30.26 Gy). Rectum V53.7Gy was superior in RapidPlan for 4 out of 5 patients, but the mean dose was worse overall (18.59 Gy vs. 16.32 Gy). Variation in the ΔDMean for the rectum was found ranged from 0.36 Gy to 8.13 Gy.Conclusion: The RapidPlan model saved 66% of the planning time and produced comparable CTV coverage and superior or equivalent OAR sparing for prostate patients.Purpose: To compare proton ranges calculated in the treatment planning system (TPS) based on images of dual-layer CT (DLCT) and single-energy CT (SECT) with those from Monte Carlo simulations.Methods and materials: Electron density (ED), atomic number (Z), and conventional CT images were acquired on Philips IQon spectral CT for nine animal tissues in 19.5 cm × 9 cm × 19 cm acrylic boxes. The DLCT method directly utilized stopping power ratios (SPR) calculated from ED and Z. The SECT method mapped HU to SPR. The treatment plans of 150.3 MeV and 221.3 MeV pristine energy layers were individually created in Varian Eclipse for both methods. The SECT plan was simulated with a fully commissioned TOPAS-based Monte Carlo model of a synchrotron proton beam delivery system PROBEAT-V. The proton range, R90, determined by DLCT and SECT were comparatively evaluated against the MC model.Results: For 221.3 MeV, the deviation of proton range in TPS from Monte Carlo simulation reduced from 1.9–4.6 mm for SECT to 0.2–1.3 mm with DLCT (Table 1). The largest deviations occurred in fresh and frozen lung tissues. For 150 MeV, differences were less dramatic. However, DLCT continued to agree better with Monte Carlo simulations than SECT for lung tissues.Conclusions: The DLCT-based range calculation in TPS agreed with Monte Carlo simulation to within 1.3 mm of 30.96 cm water-equivalent length for all tested animal tissues and within 0.5 mm for lung tissues. This finding supports the adoption of DLCT for dose calculation in TPS.Objective: This study aims to examine the usefulness of PTV created by a uniform expansion of CTV to improve the CTV coverage in robustly optimized intensity modulated proton therapy treatment plans.Method &amp; Materials: IMPT treatment plans were optimized in Eclipse TPS from Varian Medical Systems using Nonlinear Universal Proton Optimizer (NUPO) for targets in brain and other regions of head and neck. The CTV was selected for robust optimization under eight uncertainties scenarios corresponding 3.5% range uncertainties and +/-3 mm setup uncertainties. Two plans for each patient were created, one with and one without the non-robust minimum target coverage objective for PTV. The PTV was customized to avoid overlap with OARs. Robustness of the CTV coverage under the same eight uncertainties scenarios were analyzed for both plans. The D95 for the CTV in the uncertainties band DVH for the worst-case scenario was used to judge the usefulness of the PTV in improving the robustness of IMPT plans.Results: The IMPT plans with the minimum PTV target coverage objective are found to have a better D95 for CTV compared to the IMPT plans without this objective in the plan optimization with comparable DVHs for the OARs.Conclusion: The PTV was found to be useful in improving the robustness of the IMPT plans for target coverage under range and setup uncertainties.Several models of variable RBE may be implemented in clinical and research-based treatment planning systems for carbon radiotherapy, including the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM), stochastic MKM (SMKM), and Local Effect Model I (LEM), which have not been thoroughly compared. This work compares how models handle carbon beam fragmentation, providing insight into where model differences arise. Geant4 Monte Carlo was used to simulate clinically realistic monoenergetic and SOBP carbon beams incident on a phantom. Using these, input parameters for each RBE model (microdosimetric spectra, double strand break yield, kinetic energy spectra, dose) were calculated for relevant fragment species (H, He, Li, Be, B, and C). Spectra for each fragment were used to calculate linear and quadratic portions of each RBE model, which were combined with reference values and physical dose to calculate RBE. Calculations found that secondary fragment contributions could exceed 20% of total physical dose (Figure). When calculated using identical beam parameters, RBE magnitude varied greatly across models and was typically lowest using MKM. When compared across fragments, RBE decreased with atomic number when Z&lt;3 and increased when Z≥3 for RBE(MKM) and RBE(SMKM) (Table). RBE(LEM) increased with Z, until dropping sharply at Z=6. Trends of RBE by fragment varied by LET region for microdosimetric models only. This study demonstrated that secondary fragments can contribute notably to physical and estimated biological dose, indicating that fragmentation is an important factor in treatment delivery. Similar trends were seen in RBE fluctuations by atomic number for microdosimetric models, which differed from those of RBE(LEM).Introduction: For patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), proton therapy can provide dosimetric advantages over photon radiation. However, it is unknown whether this translates into superior outcomes. We conducted a phase II clinical trial of chemoradiation for LA-NSCLC examining response-adaptive radiation dose-escalation and compared the proton and photon patient cohorts on this trial.Methods: Forty-five patients with AJCCv7 stage IIB-IIIB NSCLC were prospectively enrolled (NCT02773238) in 2016-2019. All patients underwent chemoradiation (23=protons, 22=photon IMRT); 18 patients also received consolidation durvalumab. PET/CT was performed at week-3 during chemoradiation and response status was prospectively defined by multivariate changes in tumor-volume and metabolic-uptake. PET non-responders received 74Gy in 30 fractions whereas PET-responders received 60Gy in 30 fractions. Differences between cohorts were evaluated by Mann-Whitney U-tests and log-rank tests.Results: The cohort of patients treated with proton radiation had significantly lower dose to the lungs and heart with similar PTV volume (Table 1). Median follow up was 19 months. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (2y 61% vs. 40%, p=0.10), progression-free survival (1y 66% vs. 43%, p=0.28), locoregional control (1y 89% vs. 78%, p=0.10), or pneumonitis rate (1y 35% vs. 45%, p=0.65) in the two patient cohorts (Figure 1).Conclusion: Our cohort of patients treated with proton therapy had lower radiation dose to lungs and heart, although there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes. Our results maybe be limited by our sample size, and we await results from larger randomized trials.Introduction: Multi-agent chemotherapy followed by proton radiotherapy (PRT) is a standard treatment option for aggressive mediastinal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AMNHL). Long-term outcomes remain favorable and minimizing dose to organs at risk is paramount. We report outcomes of patients with AMNHL receiving chemotherapy followed by either pencil beam scanning (PBS) or double scattered (DS) PRT.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from a convenience sample of 24 patients with AMNHL treated between 2012-2019 at our institution. Median age was 36 (range 21-74), and disease stage distribution was 10 stage I, 10 stage II, 2 stage III, and 2 stage IV. Patients received either R-CHOP (18/24) or R-CHP-BV (6/24). Bulky disease (≥7.5cm) was present in 22/24 and 10/24 had B symptoms. Radiation toxicity was graded by CTCAEv5.Results: Median follow-up was 38.8 months (range 8.3-91.5 months) and median PRT dose was 30.6Gy (range 30-39.6Gy). DS was used in 13/24, PBS in 11/24, and both in 6/24. Deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) was used in 10/24. Median mean lung dose was 4.6Gy (range 2.4-7.4Gy) for PBS and 6.8Gy (range 3-16.7Gy) for DS, while median mean heart dose was 10.5Gy (range 5.9-16.4Gy) for PBS and 7.3Gy (range .01-16.9Gy) for DS. Grade 1 (G1) toxicities occurred in 16 patients and G2 toxicities in 4. G1 radiation pneumonitis occurred in one patient with no ≥G2 pneumonitis. A complete metabolic response was observed in 87.5% of patients (Figure 1).Conclusion: Consolidative PRT following chemotherapy for AMNHL resulted in favorable outcomes without high-grade toxicities.Purpose: To systematically review all dosimetric studies investigating the impact of deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) compared with free breathing (FB) in mediastinal lymphoma patients treated with proton therapy as compared to IMRT-DIBH.Materials and Methods: A systematic search in PubMed was done to identify studies of mediastinal lymphoma patients with dosimetric comparisons of proton-FB and/or proton-DIBH with IMRT-DIBH including mean heart, lung, and breast doses (named MHD, MLD, and MBD respectively). Case reports were excluded. As of December 2020, eight studies fit these criteria.Results: The trends in dose are summarized in the table. MHD was reduced (n=2), similar (&lt;1 Gy difference, n=2), or worse (2.5 Gy worse, n=1) for proton-FB compared with IMRT-DIBH. MLD and MBD in all studies were reduced for proton-FB compared with IMRT-DIBH. Proton-DIBH led to lower MHD (2.3-7.4 Gy difference,) and MLD (0.7-1.1 Gy difference) compared to proton-FB, while MBD remained within 0.3 Gy in all studies. Compared with IMRT-DIBH, proton-DIBH reduced the MHD (1.5-10.1 Gy, n=7) or was similar (n=1). MLD (1.7-3.9 Gy) and MBD (1.5-7.8 Gy) were reduced with proton-DIBH in all studies. Integral dose was similar between proton-FB and proton-DIBH, and both were substantially lower than IMRT-DIBH.Conclusion: Accounting for heart, lung, breast, and integral dose, proton therapy (FB or DIBH) was superior to IMRT-DIBH. Proton-DIBH can lower dose to the lungs and heart even further compared with proton-FB. However, the substantial increase in physics resources required at simulation and treatment must be considered to ensure accurate reproducibility for proton-DIBH treatment delivery.Purpose: To report the dosimetric impact of rotation in temporary tissue expanders (TE) in patients receiving post-mastectomy intensity modulated proton radiotherapy (IMPT).Methods: Between 2017-2020, we identified consecutive patients in an internal registry as having a rotated TE during treatment. TE rotations were identified",international journal of particle therapy,['2331-5180'],journal,0,[],,,False,

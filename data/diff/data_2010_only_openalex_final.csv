Film growth in ALD is precise, remarkably repeatable, and combined with unparalleled control of the film thickness. These inherent properties make ALD an attractive method to deposit thin films for advanced technological applications such as microelectronics and nanotechnology. One material group in ALD which has matured in ten years and proven to be of wide technological importance is noble metals. The purpose of this study was to investigate noble metal oxide film growth by ALD. The ALD of noble metal oxides has been very limited compared to the noble metal growth. Another aim was to examine noble metal film deposition at temperatures lower than required in the earlier ALD noble metal processes. In addition, the selection of noble metals that can be grown by ALD was expanded with osmium. The results of the study showed that oxides of iridium, rhodium, platinum, and palladium can be deposited from the common noble metal precursors using ozone as the reactant at temperatures below 200 C. The development of ozone-based ALD noble metal oxide processes led further on to the low temperature deposition of noble metals by adding a reductive molecular hydrogen step after every oxidative ozone step. The noble metal deposition via noble metal oxide growth was achieved at lower temperatures than required with the common oxygen-based ALD noble metal processes. Film growth rates, resistivities, purities, and surface roughnesses resulting from the studied noble metal oxide and noble metal processes were reasonable. The processes showed some shortcomings but offer an alternative thermal ALD pathway to deposit noble metals and noble metal oxides compared to the oxygen-based ALD processes.",,,,7,"['https://openalex.org/W1880191198', 'https://openalex.org/W1981965967', 'https://openalex.org/W1993283300', 'https://openalex.org/W1996783389', 'https://openalex.org/W2031306112', 'https://openalex.org/W2032306276', 'https://openalex.org/W2060883520', 'https://openalex.org/W2088569164', 'https://openalex.org/W2089627632', 'https://openalex.org/W2119164620', 'https://openalex.org/W2312407956', 'https://openalex.org/W2498336437']",Hämäläinen,,False,

For the technology to be able to make a significant impact though, more efficient materials need to be developed. This is a huge challenge because of the interdependence of the physical properties that affect the performance of a thermoelectric material, and nanostructuring might be the only way to overcome this obstacle. This thesis presents research on the effect of inorganic dopants and inorganic-organic hybrid superlattice structures on the thermoelectric properties of ZnO thin films. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to fabricate the thin films in this study due to the suitability of the technique for the deposition of precisely controlled nanostructures. 

Zinc oxide is one of the most promising thermoelectric oxide materials, especially when doped with for instance Al or Ga, but it is somewhat held back by the lack of a stable p-type ZnO material. The effects of aluminum and phosphorus doping on the thermoelectric properties of ALD-grown ZnO thin films were investigated in this work, and both were found to increase the carrier concentration of ZnO, with Al turning out to be the better dopant in terms of improving thermoelectric performance. An attempt was also made to induce p-type conductivity in ZnO through thermal treatment of the P-doped films, but a deterioration of the electrical properties of the films was observed instead. 

The fabrication of super lattice structures of organic layers within ZnO with a combination of the atomic and molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques was successfully demonstrated for three different organic precursors: hydroquinone, 4-aminophenol and 4,4'-oxydianiline. All of the organic molecules were found to have an effect on the electrical and thermoelectric properties of ZnO, the magnitude of which varied noticeably between the different organic constituents despite their relatively similar structures. The observed effects from the introduction of the hybrid superlattice structures amounted to only small changes in the thermoelectric power factor of ZnO, and these changes were not cumulative with the effects of Al doping when hybrid superlattices were combined with Al doping. The net effect from the organic layers on the thermoelectric performance of ZnO is predicted to be greater than implied by the slight changes in power factor due to the expected decrease in thermal conductivity resulting from phonon inhibition by the organic layers.; Termosahkoisella energialouhinnalla on mahdollisuus vahentaa riippuvuuttamme perinteisista energialahteista kayttamalla hyvaksi hyodyntamattomia hukkalammon lahteita ja muuttamalla ne sahkoksi.

L. Butterworth, Nicholas Becker, Z. Gainsforth, Antonio Lanzirotti, M. Newville, Thomas Proslier, Julien Stodolna, S.R. Sutton, T. Tyliszczak, A. J. Westphal, J. F. Zasadzinski",,"Quantification of synchrotron XRF analyses is typically done through comparisons with measurements on the NIST SRM 1832/1833 thin film standards. Unfortunately, these standards are inhomogeneous on small scales at the tens of percent level. We are synthesizing new homogeneous multilayer standards using the Atomic Layer Deposition technique and characterizing them using multiple analytical methods, including ellipsometry, Rutherford Back Scattering at Evans Analytical, Synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence (SXRF) at Advanced Photon Source (APS) Beamline 13-ID, Synchrotron X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at Advanced Light Source (ALS) Beamlines 11.0.2 and 5.3.2.1 and by electron microscopy techniques. Our motivation for developing much-needed cross-calibration of synchrotron techniques is borne from coordinated analyses of particles captured in the aerogel of the NASA Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector (SIDC). The Stardust Interstellar Dust Preliminary Examination (ISPE) team have characterized three sub-nanogram, {approx}1{micro}m-sized fragments considered as candidates to be the first contemporary interstellar dust ever collected, based on their chemistries and trajectories. The candidates were analyzed in small wedges of aerogel in which they were extracted from the larger collector, using high sensitivity, high spatial resolution >3 keV synchrotron x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (SXRF) and <2 keV synchrotron x-ray transmission microscopy (STXM) during Stardust ISPE. The ISPE synchrotron techniques have complementarymore » capabilities. Hard X-ray SXRF is sensitive to sub-fg mass of elements Z {ge} 20 (calcium) and has a spatial resolution as low as 90nm. X-ray Diffraction data were collected simultaneously with SXRF data. Soft X-ray STXM at ALS beamline 11.0.2 can detect fg-mass of most elements, including cosmochemically important oxygen, magnesium, aluminum and silicon, which are invisible to SXRF in this application. ALS beamline 11.0.2 has spatial resolution better than 25 nm. Limiting factors for Stardust STXM analyses were self-imposed limits of photon dose due to radiation damage concerns, and significant attenuation of <1500 eV X-rays by {approx}80{micro}m thick, {approx}25 mg/cm{sup 3} density silica aerogel capture medium. In practice, the ISPE team characterized the major, light elements using STXM (O, Mg, Al, Si) and the heavier minor and trace elements using SXRF. The two data sets overlapped only with minor Fe and Ni ({approx}1% mass abundance), providing few quantitative cross-checks. New improved standards for cross calibration are essential for consortium-based analyses of Stardust interstellar and cometary particles, IDPs. Indeed, they have far reaching application across the whole synchrotron-based analytical community. We have synthesized three ALD multilayers simultaneously on silicon nitride membranes and silicon and characterized them using RBS (on Si), XRF (on Si{sub 3}N{sub 4}) and STXM/XAS (holey Si{sub 3}N{sub 4}). The systems we have started to work with are Al-Zn-Fe and Y-Mg-Er. We have found these ALD multi-layers to be uniform at {micro}m- to nm scales, and have found excellent consistency between four analytical techniques so far. The ALD films can also be used as a standard for e-beam instruments, eg., TEM EELS or EDX. After some early issues with the consistency of coatings to the back-side of the membrane windows, we are confident to be able to show multi-analytical agreement to within 10%. As the precision improves, we can use the new standards to verify or improve the tabulated cross-sections.« less",43rd annual lunar and planetary science conference,,conference,1,[],Butterworth,,False,

In this talk, an overview of the ALD reaction sequence, fundamentals and select applications developed by Cambridge NanoTech users will be presented. Examples of these applications include the use of ALD films for gate oxides and TCOs, as well as merging organic and inorganics for use in flexible electronics, OLEDs and biomaterials.

Often these fibers are coated with nanometer thick layer before embedding into matrices to improve performance, especially life-time of the composites. In general, coatings are prepared by sol-gel or chemical vapor deposition. However, these techniques have limitations such as two or more fibers are linked by deposited coating and also form non-uniform coating thickness on fiber, which affect the composite adversely. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is one of the techniques which can overcome these problems because it can deposit very thin layer with uniform thickness. An ALD reactor has been designed, especially for meter long bundle of fibers. Various oxides have been deposited onto bundle of carbon fibers. Coatings were uniform, and it improve oxidation resistance of the fibers significantly. This book, therefore will provide a new direction for material science, especially for composites science and technology.

Various techniques have already been demonstrated to produce Ga2O3 naming evaporation, sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Among them, ALD gives the possibility of controlling the thickness at the atomic level, good step coverage and delivers dense and homogeneous films. In this contribution, we report on the growth of ALD Ga2O3 using trimethylgallium (TMG) and H2O as metal and oxygen precursors, respectively. We deposited thin Ga2O3 films on Si, TiO2, Al2O3 and RuO2 over a temperature range of 150-300°C and characterized them by X-ray photo emission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy.

The REScO3, LaLuO3 and ErxGa2-xO3 thin films investigated are potential high-κ materials for future metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, i.e. MOSFETs. The dissertation consists of five peer reviewed publications. As a background for the work, issues related to the miniaturization of MOSFETs and the feasibility of rare earth oxides as new high-κ dielectrics are discussed. Also some challenges of manufacturing Ga-based MOSFETs with high quality gate oxide having satisfactory interface properties and the role of rare earth oxides in GaAs passivation are presented. In addition the basic principle of the ALD method is briefly introduced and recent literature concerning deposition of rare earth oxides is reviewed. A series of REScO3 thin films was deposited by ALD using rare earth β-diketonate precursors RE(thd)3 together with ozone. The films were characterized for growth rate, elemental composition, crystallization upon annealing and electrical properties. Amorphous films of high quality with low impurity contents and promising electrical characteristics were produced. Several gradually evolving properties of the films were examined and the effect of the RE3+ cation size was discussed. YScO3 films were also deposited using novel cyclopentadienyl metal precursors and water. Deposition of LaLuO3 films having similar properties but even higher dielectric constant (κ ≈ 30) than ternary scandates was examined at two different temperatures. The relationship between the crystallization behaviour and the dielectric constant of REScO3 and LaLuO3 thin films was discussed. Finally deposition of a possible gate oxide for GaAs MOSFETs, viz. ErxGa2-xO3 by two different precursor approaches was investigated. In addition to β-diketonate metal precursors novel cyclopentadienyl and amidinate metal precursors together with water as oxygen source were utilized. For both YScO3 and ErxGa2-xO3 films the choice of precursor system affected e.g. the electrical properties and the crystallization behavior.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1502853825', 'https://openalex.org/W1659914018', 'https://openalex.org/W2067349416', 'https://openalex.org/W2092584346', 'https://openalex.org/W2137089216', 'https://openalex.org/W2158331064', 'https://openalex.org/W2463538251', 'https://openalex.org/W589995197']",Myllymäki,,False,

To help solve this problem, the uptake, the surface chemistry, and the effect of hydrogen coadsorption of copper(I)( N,N' -di- sec -butylacetamidinate) and N,N' -di- sec -butylacetamidine on different metals were characterized under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions by using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The main objective of this research project has been to develop a better molecular-level understanding of the chemical reactions associated with ALD of copper metal films, to design and optimize the film deposition processes to be used in the microelectronics industry. In our initial studies on a Ni (110) single crystal, a temperature window between approximately 350 and 450 K was identified for the ALD of Cu using the Cu acetamidinate precursor: lower temperatures are insufficient for activation of the dissociative adsorption, and higher temperatures lead to continuous decomposition beyond Cu monolayer saturation. Approximately three dosing cycles are required to reach full Cu monolayer saturation, the equivalent of a film growth rate of ~0.75 A/cycle in ALD. Preadsorption of hydrogen on the surface does not modify any of this behavior because of its rapid desorption at temperatures below 350 K once the gas-phase H2is removed. The surface chemistry of the Cu precursor is complex, leading to the desorption of not only hydrogen but also 2-butene and small amdine ( N-sec -butylacetamidine, s But-NH-C(CH3)=NH); it seems that the amidine ligands decompose via beta-hydride elimination from one of their terminal sec -butyl moieties. The ligands of the copper acetamidinate precursors further decompose on Ni (110) surfaces at higher temperature, leading to the desorption of more hydrogen and leaving some carbon and nitrogen on the surface. The free hydrogenated amidine ligand is less reactive, and no N-sec -butylacetamidine is produced by its thermal activation, but the remaining chemistry follows similar temperature transitions. Similar results were also observed on a Cu (110) surface.Other copper precursors, Cu-KI5 (copper (I) (N(1(dimethylvinylsiloxy)-1- methylethano)-2-imino-4-pentanoate)) and Cu(acac) 2 (copper(II) acetylacetonate) in particular, were tested as well.

Passivation performance is improved remarkably by annealing at temperatures of 450 C and 500 C, while the improvement is quite weak at 600 C, which can be attributed to the poor quality of chemical passivation. An increase of fixed negative charge density in the films during annealing can be explained by the Al2O3/Si interface structural change.

The latter includes circular transfer length method and linear test structures. The resistivity increased significantly with decreasing film thickness below 4 nm, as well as the discrepancy between the optical and electrical method.

Zirconium to Yittrium ratio for both cases is about 1/8. Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM) image shows that the growth rate per hour for Atomic Layer Deposition is faster than for sputtering. X-ray Photo-electron Spectroscopy(XPS) shows that the peaks of both Zirconia and Yittria shift towards higher bending energy for the case of Atomic Layer deposition and thus are more strongly attached to the substrate. Later, Nyquist plot was used to compare the conductivity of Yittria Stabilized Electrolyte for both cases. The conductivity at 300?C for Atomic Layer Deposited Yittria Stabilized Zirconia is found to be 5{times}10^{-4}S/cm while that for sputtered Yittria Stabilized Zirconia is 2{times}10^{-5}S/cm at the same temperature.

Tran,"Permeance, Membrane Technology, Water-gas shift reaction","Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can significantly contribute to the reduction of the emission of the greenhouse gas CO2. Capture by means of CO2 sorption or membrane-based separation processes is a promising way for achieving decarbonization of fuel or flue gas cleaning. In the field of separation and also purification of hydrogen, membrane separation technology has been and still is a focal point for Research and Development (R&D) due to its promising energy-efficiency, inherent selectivity and continuous operation. Research is being devoted to the development of membranes for H2 separation from CO and CO2 containing gas mixtures with high permeance and selectivity for conversion to electricity via fuel cells or directly in gas turbines. Currently, most membranes are being developed to separate H2 from the underlying reaction mixtures obtained via coal gasification, steam-methane reforming, and water gas-shift processes. The key advantage of membrane separation, but also sorbent-based separation, is the possibility to go beyond the thermodynamic conversion limits set by the equilibrium constant of these H2 production reactions. The in-situ separation of H2 from the gas mixture through membranes shifts the equilibrium toward higher production of H2 by preventing the back reaction. At the same time a stream of CO2 is produced, pure enough for storage in geological reservoirs (empty oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifers) or for use in enhanced oil or gas recovery processes. Inorganic microporous membranes are considered promising for H2 separation in high-temperature H2 production processes because of their high thermal and chemical stability. The major objective of the thesis is dedicated to fabricate and study a microporous non-silica based membrane system, consisting of an ?-alumina macroporous support, a mesoporous intermediate layer, and a microporous ?-Al2O3, or TiO2 top layer, for H2 separation from a gas mixture with CO and CO2. We have studied the possibility to incorporate Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 into the envisioned structure using the synthesis concept of a combination of sol-gel and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) processes. The foremost goal of the ALD related membrane research was to provide enhanced H2 selectivity of the synthesized membranes. Tests on the H2/CO2 separation were carried out on these synthesized membranes. The H2 permeance and H2/CO2 selectivity of these membranes are ~1-2x10?7 mol.m?2.s?1.Pa?1 and ~ 5.8-10.9 at 175 °C and 105 Pa pressure difference, respectively. It was shown that ALD can elegantly be coupled with the sol-gel synthesis to fabricate microporous membranes on a large scale.",,,,0,[],Tran,,False,

Delamare, Olivier Poncelet, Xiaohui Tang, Laurent A. Francis, Denis Flandre","Passivation, Aluminium oxides, Field effect","Atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) aluminum oxide (Al2O3) has recently demonstrated an excellent surface passivation for both n- and p-type c-Si solar cells thanks to the presence of high negative fixed charges (Qf ∼ 1012−1013 cm −2) in combination with a low density of interface states (Dit). This paper investigates the passivation quality of thin (15 nm) Al2O3 films deposited by two different techniques: plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) and Thermal atomic layer deposition (T-ALD). Other dielectric materials taken into account for comparison include: thermally-grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) (20 nm), SiO2 (20 nm) deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiNx:H) (20 nm) also deposited by PECVD. With the above-mentioned dielectric layers, Metal Insulator Semiconductor (MIS) capacitors were fabricated for Qf and Dit extraction through Capacitance-Voltage-Conductance (C-V -G) measurements. In addition, lifetime measurements were carried out to evaluate the effective surface recombination velocity (SRV). The influence of extracted C-V -G parameters (Qf ,Dit) on the injection dependent lifetime measurements τ (Δn), and the dominant passivation mechanism involved have been discussed.

Thin films were prepared using atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. Design/methodology/approach: The microanalysis was investigated by the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDS. The changes in surface topography was observed by the atomic force microscope AFM XE-100 and scanning electron microscope SEM. The results of roughness was obtained by the software XEI Park Systems. The measurement of thickness and dispersion of refractive index was performed using SE800 PV spectroscopic ellipsometer. The optical reflection was investigated by the spectrometer UV/VIS. Findings: Results and their analysis allow to conclude that the atomic layer deposition method enables uniform coating of smooth and complicated shapes surfaces. The thin film thickness depends only on the number of cycles, so that can be easily control the thickness of the material. Practical implications: Knowledge about the ALD Al2O3 optical parameters and the possibility to obtaining a uniform thin films show that the previously named material has a big potential in photovoltaic application.

To achieve this goal using ever-thinner silicon wafers, a highly effective surface passivation of the cell front and rear is required. In the past, finding a suitable dielectric layer providing a high-quality rear passivation has been a major challenge. Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) has only recently turned out to be a nearly perfect candidate for such a dielectric. However, conventional ALD is limited to deposition rates well below 2nm/min, which is incompatible with industrial solar cell production.

From electronic device point of view, graphene is a promising material for future smaller and faster electronics, and it demands extensive amount of research. In this work, graphene is used as the channel material in field effect transistors (FETs). First KTH’s back-gate and top-gate graphene FETs (GFETs) were fabricated using exfoliated graphene on 90 nm thick silicon dioxide films on silicon substrates. Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) high-K gate insulator was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Back-gate transfer characteristics of uncovered devices show current modulation with hysteresis and a charge neutrality point about +5 V. After 20 nm thick Al2O3 film deposition, hysteresis is effectively suppressed, and the charge neutrality point moves toward negative gate voltages of about -14 V. Furthermore, the mobility is just degraded by a factor of two after high-k deposition process. The electrical characterization confirmed the effectiveness of the fabrication and reveals the importance of contact optimization for device performance and mobility extraction.",,,,12,"['https://openalex.org/W1579693397', 'https://openalex.org/W1991859775', 'https://openalex.org/W1993759767', 'https://openalex.org/W1994643625', 'https://openalex.org/W1995191254', 'https://openalex.org/W2001583292', 'https://openalex.org/W2018652376', 'https://openalex.org/W2042680035', 'https://openalex.org/W2051105944', 'https://openalex.org/W2058122340', 'https://openalex.org/W2060009331', 'https://openalex.org/W2072836371', 'https://openalex.org/W2080159084', 'https://openalex.org/W2087638855', 'https://openalex.org/W2087899039', 'https://openalex.org/W2099779584', 'https://openalex.org/W2101312334', 'https://openalex.org/W2102415385', 'https://openalex.org/W2105685140', 'https://openalex.org/W2119882629', 'https://openalex.org/W2121772044', 'https://openalex.org/W2121990892', 'https://openalex.org/W2125305648', 'https://openalex.org/W2147789376', 'https://openalex.org/W2154054997', 'https://openalex.org/W2158502284', 'https://openalex.org/W254896380', 'https://openalex.org/W3103107222', 'https://openalex.org/W3105373225']",Vaziri,,False,

Nanotechnology, a new scientific frontier, promises to revolutionize innovation in many industries. Advancements in nanotechnology are being applied in the water-purification industry to keep harmful bacteria out of drinking water. Due to its bactericidal properties, nano silver is used in many products as an antibacterial. This study aimed to produce a nano silver-coated water-treatment polypropylene filter via the physical vapor deposition method using the Balzers 760 machine equipped with an electron beam gun ESQ 110. The Balzers machine was modified in order to enable coating of the cylindrical filters in a homogenous manner. The nano silver particles were made by electron beam bombardment of the silver metal, which were subsequently deposited on the polypropylene filter evenly. The thickness of the nano layer coated on the filter was about 55.0nm in average, as revealed by the microprocessor unit of the Balzers machine during the coating process. The thickness of the nano layer and the chemical composition of the produced filters were studied by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and the X-ray diffraction technique. The filter system produced in this work has the potential to be used as an efficient and cost-effective water treatment method. The inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) studies revealed that there was no nano silver particle present in the filtered water sample.

Measurements of the coated detector show a resolution comparable to uncoated detectors, and a memory effect reduction of a factor of 1000.

Growth parameters have been optimized for producing large area single- and bilayer graphene. These materials have been characterized using Raman spectroscopy methods developed in this program for determining layer number, stacking order, and defects in graphene. Device processing methods have also been developed, including atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics with fabricated field-effect transistors (FETs) demonstrating 3-GHz threshold frequencies. A large measured device data set has been produced for circuit design and device modeling validation. Models have been developed to assist in the electrical characterization of the graphene/substrate interface that takes into account interface defects. Graphene FETs will find applications in high frequency communication and radar systems.

Hall,"Quartz Crystal Microbalance, Deposition, Nanoindenter","Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and its subset, Molecular layer deposition (MLD), is a thin film deposition technique using alternating self-limiting precursors to grow thin films on a substrates. Recent research has expanded MLD to use reactive metal alkyls/halides and organic fragments containing alcohol groups such as ethylene glycol for use in protective barriers. Unfortunately using ethylene glycol as a precursor causes film stability issues and does not provide adequate mechanical properties for projected uses. The current research looks into the investigation of using different metal alkyls and metal halides with the trifunctional precursor glycerol. The three main films investigated were the AlGL using trimethylaluminum and glycerol, ZnGL using diethyl zinc and glycerol and TIGL using titanium (IV) chloride and glycerol. The films were investigated using quartz crystal microbalance, X-ray reflectivity, and spectroscopic ellipsometry for characterization of their film growth. All films exhibited linear growth at a range of temperatures above 130° C with AlGL, ZnGL and TiGL displaying a growth rate at 150° C of ~ 2.34 A/cycle, ~ 1.29 A/cycle, and ~ 2.2 A/cycle respectfully. Initially film growth was investigated in situ using quartz crystal microbalance and then the growth rates confirmed ex situ using X-ray reflectivity. Once the film growth and mechanism were investigated, the mechanical properties were investigated to determine if there was an improvement in cross-linking in the films. The mechanical properties of these MLD films were also investigated using a mechanical testing system and nanoindenter. The mechanical properties for AlGL and ZnGL showed a large improvement from 0.69% to 1.2% for their critical tensile strain compared to previous MLD films. The films also showed an increase in mechanical properties from their nanoindentation results consistent with an increase in cross-linking.",,,,2,[],Hall,,False,

The growth of LS multilayers on quartz slides was monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy, and the absorbance at 205 nm as well as at 280 nm was found to linearly increase with the number of layers. The formation of LS multilayers on fibers surfaces was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The XPS results showed that the surface contents of the characteristic elements, S and Cu, of LS multilayers were increased with the number of layers, which suggests the deposition of LS-Cu2+ complexes on cellulose fibers. Furthermore, there was a good linear relationship between the calculated surface LS content and the increment of LS layers. The AFM morphology results confirmed that the cellulose microfibrils on fiber surface were gradually covered by LS particles, resulting in the increase of surface roughness as self-assembly proceeded. The hydrophobicity of cellulose fiber probed by dynamic contact angle was significantly increased due to LBL self-assembly of LS on its surface. The initial contact angle was increased from 0° to 115° as the cellulose fibers were modified with a 5-layer LS multilayer. The reduction rate of the contact angle was dependent on the number of layers. When the cellulose fiber was modified by a 5-layer LS multilayer, the contact angle shifted from 115 to 98° after 0.12 s, suggesting some degree of hydrophobic character. Therefore, this technique provides a simple but effective way for promoting hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers in a controllable manner.",doaj (doaj: directory of open access journals),,repository,16,"['https://openalex.org/W139011426', 'https://openalex.org/W1503747664', 'https://openalex.org/W1542350890', 'https://openalex.org/W196409265', 'https://openalex.org/W1964894352', 'https://openalex.org/W1976228654', 'https://openalex.org/W1977054783', 'https://openalex.org/W1981563023', 'https://openalex.org/W1986710419', 'https://openalex.org/W1998595953', 'https://openalex.org/W2007744989', 'https://openalex.org/W2014827498', 'https://openalex.org/W2014909090', 'https://openalex.org/W2016208439', 'https://openalex.org/W2029193786', 'https://openalex.org/W2048414110', 'https://openalex.org/W2048584115', 'https://openalex.org/W2058649105', 'https://openalex.org/W2064057610', 'https://openalex.org/W2065325816', 'https://openalex.org/W2067630730', 'https://openalex.org/W2080766118', 'https://openalex.org/W2081441029', 'https://openalex.org/W2084895845', 'https://openalex.org/W2089048912', 'https://openalex.org/W2090748776', 'https://openalex.org/W2117208350', 'https://openalex.org/W2168022187', 'https://openalex.org/W2170750193', 'https://openalex.org/W2330188839']",Li,,False,

Zhang,"Gloss (optics), Visible spectrum, Degradation","TiO2 has been widely applied as white artistic pigment since 19th century. And the photo-catalytic effect of TiO2 makes it aggressive and causes degradation on painting surface. The damage of binder by TiO2, also known as chalking, has been suggested as the main cause of the painting surface degradation and studied a lot. However, the danger to pigments used with TiO2 together, especially the organic ones, is rarely noticed. In this study, artistic TiO2 and industrial TiO2 were studied: a Titanium white pigment from Kremer, industrial catalyst from Hombikat and Hombikat coated with Al2O3 in an atomic layer deposition process. The titanium dioxides were mixed with five colorant pigments and linseed oil into paints. After drying, the paint films were illuminated under artificial light to reveal the surface change caused by TiO2. After artificial light aging, the color, gloss and roughness of all films have changed. As expected, Hombikat TiO2 is proved to induce most changes. The Hombikat TiO2 degrades the binder and the colorant pigments in combination with light. The coating of Hombikat with Al2O3 shows little effectiveness in preventing the degradation. The Kremer TiO2 mainly degrades the binder to cause surface change. The degradation of the binder contributes to the roughness increase mostly. The color of Green earth is not affected by any of the three titanium dioxides. Vermilion’s blackening phenomenon is largely boosted by TiO2. Prussian blue degrades faster than others.

Zimmermann, Marika Edoff, Tobias Törndahl","Buffer (optical fiber), Chemical bath deposition","CdS is conventionally used as a buffer layer in Cu(In,Ga)Se2, CIGS, solar cells. The aim of this thesis is to substitute CdS with cadmium-free, more transparent and environmentally benign alternative buffer layers and to analyze how the material properties of alternative layers affect the solar cell performance. The alternative buffer layers have been deposited using Atomic Layer Deposition, ALD. A theoretical explanation for the success of CdS is that its conduction band, Ec, forms a small positive offset with that of CIGS. In one of the studies in this thesis the theory is tested experimentally by changing both the Ec position of the CIGS and of Zn(O,S) buffer layers through changing their gallium and sulfur contents respectively. Surprisingly, the top performing solar cells for all gallium contents have Zn(O,S) buffer layers with the same sulfur content and properties in spite of predicted unfavorable Ec offsets. An explanation is proposed based on observed non-homogenous composition in the buffer layer. This thesis also shows that the solar cell performance is strongly related to the resistivity of alternative buffer layers made of (Zn,Mg)O. A tentative explanation is that a high resistivity reduces the influence of shunt paths at the buffer layer/absorber interface. For devices in operation however, it seems beneficial to induce persistent photoconductivity, by light soaking, which can reduce the effective Ec barrier at the interface and thereby improve the fill factor of the solar cells. Zn-Sn-O is introduced as a new buffer layer in this thesis. The initial studies show that solar cells with Zn-Sn-O buffer layers have comparable performance to the CdS reference devices. While an intrinsic ZnO layer is required for a high reproducibility and performance of solar cells with CdS buffer layers it is shown in this thesis that it can be thinned if Zn(O,S) or omitted if (Zn,Mg)O buffer layers are used instead. As a result, a top conversion efficiency of 18.1 % was achieved with an (Zn,Mg)O buffer layer, a record for a cadmium and sulfur free CIGS solar cell.",,,,1,[],Hultqvist,,False,

However, these approaches have several drawbacks such as limitation of size control, separation of the individual structures, agglomeration or bundling of the structures. To overcome such a weakness of these synthesis methods, electrochemical anodization of a metal substrate to form self-organized metal oxide nanostructures has been widely studied. The self-organizing anodization approach allows an easy control on the dimensions of the anodic structures (layer thickness, pore diameter, interpore distance) and directly provides back-contacted oxides as functional electrodes. 
In particular, self-organized TiO2 nanotubes are the most extensively studied structures because valuable properties of TiO2, like semiconductive behavior, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties, can be enhanced by controlling their geometry. In order to form self-organized TiO2 nanotube structures, the anodization is mostly carried out in fluoride ion-containing electrolytes. By controlling the anodization conditions, the morphology of TiO2 nanotubes can be tuned. Furthermore, in fluoride-free electrolyte (for example, hot glycerol/K2HPO4 electrolytes) other types of TiO2 nanostructures can be formed, such as mesoporous and nanochannel structures. However, detailed investigations about the mechanism of formation of self-organized anodic TiO2 nanostructures in such an electrolyte have not been performed yet.
 In this context, the preset thesis focuses on revealing the critical anodization conditions to form various TiO2 nanostructures in fluoride-containing and fluoride-free electrolytes. Based on the acquired knowledge, the self-organizing anodization approaches are extended to other promising materials like Ta, Nb and W. Furthermore, well-defined metal oxide nanostructures shown in this thesis are used for several promising applications.",,,,1,[],Lee,,False,

Asztalos, Wolfgang Hennig, Xia Llc",,"Well designed detectors, including such examples as ARSA, SAUNA, and XIA's “PhosWatch”, can readily achieve the state of the art radioxenon detection limits required for nuclear explosion monitoring. They are also reliable, robust detectors that do not require cryogenic cooling for operation. All three employ the principle of beta-gamma coincidence detection to reduce background counting rates, using a BC404 plastic scintillator to detect the betas and a CsI(Tl) or NaI scintillator to detect the gamma-rays. As a consequence of this commonality of design, all three also display a “memory effect” arising from the diffusion of Xe into BC404. Thus, when one sample is pumped out of the detector, a fraction remains behind, embedded in the BC404, where it artificially raises the signal counting rate for the next sample. While this is not a fatal flaw in phoswich detectors, developing a method to eliminate the memory effect would significantly enhance their utility. In this work we proposed to develop thin, amorphous Al2O3 films to act as diffusion barriers on the BC404 surfaces exposed to radioxenon. The amorphous property is critical, since it eliminates the high diffusivity grain boundaries that occur with high densities in thin crystalline films, and Al was selected since it is known to naturally form high density amorphous films in thin layers. While we initially proposed to grow the films by depositing Al in a low pressure oxygen environment, our subsequent research revealed that ALD (atomic layer deposition) was a superior alternative, particularly because it could deposit uniform layers on arbitrarily curved surfaces (e.g. the spherical interior of the PhosWatch's BC404 detector). We therefore established a collaboration with Prof. Steven George and his group at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who are internationally known for their work on ALD and ALD deposited Al2O3 films in particular. Prof. George's group has, for example, developed methods to grow Al2O3 films that are impenetrable by H20, a molecule that is significantly smaller in diameter than Xe. Our experimental approach is therefore as follows. We have designed and built a “doser” that uses an old PhosWatch detector to deliver a calibrated dose to thin cylindrical BC404 samples. We have also built a custom counting jig to reproducibly count the BC404 samples in a phoswich geometry using a 2” CsI(Tl) crystal. Prof. George's group has created one set of BC404 samples coated with 4 thicknesses of Al2O3 at one temperature and another set of the same thickness coated at 3 different temperatures so that we can explore the parameters that create the highest quality films. We are currently developing our dosing and counting techniques using radon, which is readily available and also shows the memory effect, and then will repeat our measurements with radioxenon, which is harder to obtain and handle. Initial results with radon show a rapid initial decay in the memory effect (time constant about 1 hour) followed by a slower decay rate typical of the normal radon half life. Our present interpretation is that the shorter half life reflects diffusion of radon out of the test samples, while the slower component is a combination of radon remaining in the sample and detector contamination. The latter is most probably from exposure to atmospheric radon, since we also see it in undosed background samples. This suggests that the background effect might be substantially reduced by changing the standard measurement protocol to replace the present eight hour background measurement with an eight hour continuous pumpout.",,,,3,"['https://openalex.org/W1530619651', 'https://openalex.org/W1622640919', 'https://openalex.org/W2010716222', 'https://openalex.org/W2043641943', 'https://openalex.org/W2081978969', 'https://openalex.org/W2158932701']",Warburton,,False,

Although the interaction layer of H atoms becomes deep with increasing impact energy, dominant interaction occurs in the H- and Be-implanted layers. W atoms on the layer tend to agglomerate so that H atoms appear to have penetrated into the underlying layer. No H uptake to amorphous C leads to C sputtering as being physical sputtering but no emission of hydrocarbon (CHy). The H uptake produces C sputtering at energies much less than the threshold energy for physical sputtering, as well as dominant CHy sputtering. The Be, implanted with several % in the C layer, clearly reduces C and CHy sputtering, whereas emission of Be is found at energies less than the sputtering threshold.

The ELT was conducted using the Deep Space 1 (DS1) back-up flight engine, a 30 cm diameter xenon ion thruster. Post-test inspection of the ELT engine revealed numerous contaminant flakes distributed over the bottom of the cylindrical section of the anode within the discharge chamber (DC). Extensive analyses were conducted to determine the source of the particles, which is critical to the understanding of degradation mechanisms of long life ion thruster operation. Analyses included: optical microscopy (OM) and particle length histograms, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic oxygen plasma exposure tests. Analyses of the particles indicate that the majority of the DC flakes consist of a layered structure, typically with either two or three layers. The flakes comprising two layers were typically found to have a molybdenum-rich (Mo-rich) layer on one side and a carbon-rich (C-rich) layer on the other side. The flakes comprising three layers were found to be sandwich-like structures with Mo-rich exterior layers and a C-rich interior layer. The presence of the C-rich layers indicates that these particles were produced by sputter deposition build-up on a surface external to the discharge chamber from ion sputter erosion of the graphite target in the test chamber. This contaminant layer became thick enough that particles spalled off, and then were electro-statically attracted into the ion thruster interior, where they were coated with Mo from internal sputter erosion of the screen grid and cathode components. Atomic oxygen tests provided evidence that the DC chamber flakes are composed of a significant fraction of carbon. Particle size histograms further indicated that the source of the particles was spalling of carbon flakes from downstream surfaces. Analyses of flakes taken from the downstream surface of the accelerator grid provided additional supportive information. The production of the downstream carbon flakes, and hence the potential problems associated with the flake particles in the ELT ion thruster engine is a facility induced effect and would not occur in the space environment.",,,,4,"['https://openalex.org/W1507580806', 'https://openalex.org/W1535946065', 'https://openalex.org/W1651415313', 'https://openalex.org/W1991819391', 'https://openalex.org/W2002226616', 'https://openalex.org/W2052211281', 'https://openalex.org/W2093401824', 'https://openalex.org/W2132454915', 'https://openalex.org/W2917853867']",deGroh,,False,

Mohata,"Nanopillar, Tunnel field-effect transistor","Introduction: Tunnel field effect transistors (TFET) have gained interest recently owing to their potential in achieving sub-kT/q steep switching slope, thus promising low Vcc operation[1-5]. Steep switching slope has already been demonstrated in Silicon TFET [2]. However, it has been theoretically shown and experimentally proved that Si or SixGe1-x based homo-junction or hetero-junction TFETs would not meet the drive current requirement for future low power high performance logic applications [3]. III-V based hetero-junction TFETs have shown promise to provide MOSFET like high drive currents at low operating Vcc while providing the sub-kT/q steep switching slope[1,4,5]. However, the device design demands extremely scaled EOT and ultra-thin body double-gate geometry in order to achieve the desired transistor performance [4]. In this paper, we discuss a vertical TFET fabrication process with self-aligned gate [6] which can ultimately lead to the ultra-thin double-gate device geometry in order to achieve the desired TFET performance. Nanopillar Tunnel Transistor Fabrication: Fig. 1 shows the cross-section schematics of the fabricated TFET following key process steps. Also shown is a summary of the entire fabrication process flow. In0.53Ga0.47As layers were epitaxially grown on semi-insulating InP substrate using solid state MBE. The top P+ layer is 260nm thick and C doped at 5x10/cm. This was followed by 100nm thick intrinsic channel and 260nm thick N+ layer, doped at 10/cm with Si. 250nm thick Molybdenum(Mo) was blanket deposited on P+ InGaAs using ebeam evaporation. Cr/Ti dry etch masks with minimum width of 250nm were created on Mo using e –beam Lithography, ebeam evaporation and lift-off techniques. Mo and InGaAs were dry etched using Cl2 and SF6 based chemistry. Dry etch of InGaAs was carried to a depth of 300nm. To remove sidewall damage and produce undercut, wet etch was performed using H3PO4, H2O2 and DI water (1:2:40) for 30 secs. An undercut of 55nm was obtained and the net InGaAs MESA height became 380nm. This undercut is important for the formation of self aligned gate. After the wet etch, 5nm Al2O3 (high-k) was deposited as gate dielectric using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition technique. 20nm Palladium (Pd) gate was vertically deposited using ebeam evaporation. The entire structure was then planarized with BCB and cured at 250C for 60mins in nitrogen ambient. After curing, BCB was etched back to expose Pd on top of Mo. Pd and Al2O3 were then bombarded off using Cl2 and Ar based dry etch recipe. Lithography was followed to open large contact pads for source, drain and the gate. Ti/Pd/Au probing contacts were then deposited and lifted off. Device Characterization and Modeling: Figures 2 (a) and (b) show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a 250nm drawn mesa width fabricated TFET device. Figure 3 shows the two terminal PIN current densities plotted for different MESA widths. Clearly, the Zener (reverse) side of the characteristics overlap on top of each other confirming the success in achieving the isolation between the top source and the side wall gate (self aligned). This also indicates that the PIN leakage floor in the transfer characteristics can be scaled by scaling the mesa width with this planarization approach. Figure 4(a) shows the simulated [7] transfer characteristics for different mesa width devices. Nearly 2 orders of improvement in Ion/Ioff is expected by scaling the mesa area from 20x20 μm to 0.25x5μm. Improvement in switching slope (Figure 4(b)) is also expected with MESA scaling due to reduction in leakage floor. Figure 4(c) shows the expected output characteristics for the 250nm width mesa device with an EOT of 2.25nm. The short channel effects observed in the simulation can be reduced in future by scaling the EOT. Figure 5(a) shows the measured Id-Vg characteristics for different mesa width TFET devices. Clearly, the reduction in the leakage floor is observed experimentally due to mesa scaling. Figure 5(b) shows the variation in the switching slope with the mesa width. With mesa scaling, leakage floor reduces and the steeper part of the SS is revealed. Present devices exhibit >kT/q switching slope because of trap assisted tunneling [8]. Better oxide-semiconductor interface and switching slope can be demonstrated in the future and is independent of the current process flow. In order to achieve SS smaller than 60mV/dec slope, not only the leakage floor needs to be reduced, the Tsi needs to be reduced below 20nm [4]. The current process flow has the capability to achieve the desired Tsi width, which will require an optimization of different layer thicknesses and MESA undercut. Figure 5(c) shows output characteristics for the smallest mesa device and shows existence of short channel effects as expected from the simulations. Figure 5(d) shows increasing peak-to-valley ratio with reducing mesa dimensions in the NDR part of the output characteristics. If TFET is expected to operate as a memory element using NDR, reduced mesa dimension and increasing gate control are desired.",,,,4,[],Mohata,,False,

explored. Firstly, helical peanut-shaped
ribbons of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) were prepared by a magnetic
field-assisted electrospinning method. The formation mechanism of
helical ribbons was attributed to the synergistic interaction of
bending instability and rigidity of the polymers during the
electrospinning process. The relative humidity was found to
significantly influence the morphology of PVP fibers. When the
relative humidity of the environment decreased, the morphology
changed from straight rods to helical ribbons, and the percentage
of helical ribbons increased dramatically. At the same time, the
cross-section of electrospun fibers changed from circle, to
ellipse, and to peanut shape. These fibers had different mechanical
properties, and the helical ribbons were shown to have the largest
ultimate elongation. Secondly, SiC fibers
were synthesized by electrospinning from preceramic polymer without
the help of guiding polymer, UV Cure and pyrolysis processes. The
morphology and diameter of the electrospun preceramic fibers is
controlled by varying mixtures of solvents. UV cure was used to
crosslink and strengthen the preceramic fibers. As a result, the

Copper oxides--both cuprous oxide, Cu2O, and cupric oxide, CuO--are abundant, environmentally friendly, and highly versatile. An attractive feature unique to both copper oxides is the ease of synthesis through a one-step thermal oxidation of copper foil in ambient environment, yielding various oxide compositions and morphologies according to the oxidation temperature and time. There are many possible applications for the copper oxide materials, including pigments in ceramics, catalysts, sensors, solar cells, and batteries, to name a few. This work presents applications in electrochemical cells, more specifically photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, and gas sensors.The synthesis processes of copper oxides are characterized in terms of processing parameters and inspected with X-ray diffraction measurements and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three kinds of copper oxides were investigated for photocatalytic testing: 1 micrometer-thick, and 5 micrometer-thick Cu2O films via 0.5 hr and 10 hr oxidation at 300 °C, respectively, and a 10 micrometer-thick Cu2O film with 8 micrometer tall vertically-aligned CuO nanowire array on top via a 2 hr oxidation at 500 °C. Under AM 1.5 illumination, photocurrents of 0.8, 1.3, and 1.7 mA/cm2, respectively, were recorded for these samples, exceeding the performance of previously reported as-synthesized, co-catalyst-free copper oxide photocathodes. Possible explanations for the observed performance based on increased minority carrier diffusion length and enhanced surface electric field are discussed. Future prospects of highly photoactive and stable copper oxide-based photocathodes are also explored. The effectiveness of surface passivation for the copper oxide photocathodes using pristine and hydrogenated TiO2 thin films are quantified through prolonged photoelectrochemical testing. Photocathodes protected with TiO2 films of 50 nm thickness deposited by atomic layer deposition exhibited excellent stability, but the photocurrent dropped to ~0.06 mA/cm2. The results of CO2 reduction using electrochemically reduced Cu sites from copper oxide electrodes as precursors for CO2 reduction is also demonstrated. The proportion of reaction products H2, CO, HCOOH, and CH3COOH is shown to be tunable according to the surface morphology and composition of the original oxide electrode. Therefore, these electrodes exhibit the potential for highly selective liquid fuel production, including a measured H2/CO product ratio of ~2.6 for maximized production of liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process.A simple gas sensing architecture taking advantage of the vertically-aligned growth of CuO nanowires is demonstrated. Complete devices are formed instantly following CuO nanowire synthesis by affixing a pair of electrode pads of a second substrate on top of the nanowire array to form a complete electrical circuit. This device architecture offers simple and facile integration of nanowires into a working device. A resistance change R/R0 of ~6 was observed for 8.1% H2 concentration increasing to ~26 for 25.5% H2 concentration. Recovery time is excellent at ~0.5 min or less.

Al2O3 and AlN films were deposited on two substrates, silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) based heterostructures, AlGaN/GaN, to compare their electrical performances as alternative dielectrics for wide bandgap semiconductor based power devices. Amorphous Al2O3 was deposited at 195-200 o C at a rate of 0.75-1 i?½/cycle. The film exhibited a dielectric constant of 9 and a leakage current of 10 -3 A/cm 2 at 8 MV/cm on SiC. When it was applied on AlGaN/GaN, the Al2O3 passivation resulted in an increased sheet carrier density but a dramatic decrease in the mobility compared to those of a clean AlGaN/GaN substrate. Crystalline AlN was deposited at 540 o C with a rate of 1.5 i?½/cycle. The AlN film demonstrated a dielectric constant of 8.3 and a leakage current density of 10 -3 A/cm 2 at 4.3 MV/cm on SiC. When AlN was applied on AlGaN/GaN, an increased carrier density was observed while the mobility was at 1130 cm 2 /V-s, similar to that of a clean AlGaN/GaN. The electrical properties of synthesized AlN were promising and comparable to those of MBE or sputtering synthesized AlN, confirming the promise of ALD for synthesizing AlN. Due to their material properties, Al2O3 is preferred choice for preventing gate leakage current on SiC, whereas AlN demonstrated superior capability of passivating AlGaN/GaN. Stoichiometric LiAlSiO4 was realized at 290 o C with a rate of ~23 i?½/global cycle, in which one global cycle sequence represented 10(Al-O)-6(Li-O)-4(Si-O) ALD cycles. As-deposited films were amorphous, pin-hole free, as confirmed by electrochemical testing in ferrocene, and conformal over 3D nanowires. The ionic conductivity of LixAlySizO films was 10 -9 -10 -7 S/cm and the activation energy was 0.34-0.98 eV, both correlated to cation contents in the films. After rapid thermal annealing at 900 o C, the as-deposited LiAlSiO4 films crystallized into epitaxial b-LiAlSiO4 on Si (001) with a relationship of b-LiAlSiO4 (1 2bar 1 0) || Si (100) and b-LiAlSiO4 (1 0 1bar 0) || Si (001). The application of the LiAlSiO4 film on tin dioxide (SnO2) NWs showed that the film possessed a high ionic conductivity, which suppressed the formation of metallic Sn particles, showing the capability of LixAlySizO films to serve as electrolytes and surface modification layers in 3D Li-ion microbatteries.",,,,1,[],Perng,,False,

This is work takes forward the idea of using solid state laser technology for studying the near-surface region of a semiconductor or the interface region of a semiconductor - dielectric interface. The choice of laser (wavelength) is material dependent and the tool, built around a probe station, has the ability to measure pre-patterned small geometry samples. A detailed description of the experimental procedure is provided. The tool has the ability to form reliable ohmic contact with dielectric of thickness less than 50nm without the need for any additional etching steps. The tool is then used to monitor silicon surface change after an HF clean following which it is left to stand in the ambient over time. The results are compared with a surface sensitive contact angle tool. The near-surface PCD (ns-PCD) technique is compared to conventional microwave PCD commonly used to measure bulk lifetime of a semiconductor. The near-surface tool shows a shorter lifetime value for the back surface than the polished front surface of the sample, while microwave PCD gives the same lifetime value for both surfaces. Thus the surface sensitivity of the tool is established. Next thin dielectrics grown on semiconductors are explored using the ns-PCD technique. The time limitation for the diffusion/oxidation furnace to form high quality silicon oxide on silicon is determined to be 8 minutes. This is shown by observing the PCD lifetime that reflects the interface quality of the oxide - silicon. Two different dielectrics in alumina and tantalum oxide are grown on silicon and the PCD plots are compared. The importance of laser choice is demonstrated by taking measurements using 658nm and 980nm lasers. The former shows a more defective interface in the case of tantalum oxide. A different semiconductor material in gallium antimonide is considered in another experiment. One sample is degreased using acetone and IPA clean while the other sample is cleaned using HCl. Alumina is grown on both samples using atomic layer deposition. ns-PCD shows that HCl degrades the surface of GaSb. However forming gas anneal shows an improvement in near surface lifetime implying that HCl clean is needed to remove the uncontrolled GaO and SbO formed under ambient. Lastly it is shown that ns-PCD can be used to explore three dimensional fin structures. An ungated InGaAs quantum well fin structure is grown for this purpose. Nine devices with decreasing fin width are measured using ns-PCD. The quality of the grown fins is reflected in the plots obtained.",,,,1,[],Bhatia,,False,

RF channel-select filter banks pose a particularly attractive method for achieving multiband reconfigurability, since they not only provide the needed front-end reconfigurability, but also allow for power efficient and versatile transceiver designs, e.g., software-defined radio. Such channel-select filters, however, impose requirements on their constituent resonators that are not yet achievable on the micro-scale. Specifically, capacitively-transduced micromechanical resonators achieve high Q, but suffer from high impedance; while piezoelectric micromechanical resonators offer low impedance, but with insufficient Q. This dissertation demonstrates four new techniques to address the issues in both technologies.Two of the methods recognize that sub-30 nm gap spacing enables electrostatic resonators to achieve acceptably low impedance. Unfortunately, however, such small gaps with the needed high aspect ratios are difficult to achieve via wafer-level batch processing. Two new methods are proposed and experimentally verified for forming sub-30 nm gaps: 1) partial-filling of electrode-to-resonator gaps with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of high-k dielectric; and 2) generating gaps via the volume reduction associated with a silicidation reaction. Among the many benefits provided by a silicide-based approach to gap formation is speed of release, where sub-30 nm gaps can be formed and high-aspect-ratio microstructures can be released via anneals lasting from seconds to a few minutes, regardless the lateral dimensions of the devices. Silicide-induced gap formation further does not require any etching and is applicable to a wide range of applications, from electronics to vacuum packaging.The next two methods seek to circumvent the fact that AlN thin-film resonators have historically been measured with much lower Q than capacitive ones at similar frequencies. As a result, it was commonly accepted that the AlN thin films sputtered at low temperatures are to blame for the lower Q. This dissertation provides experimental evidence that it is not AlN material loss that restricts the Q of conventional AlN resonators, but rather the losses associated with their contacting electrodes. Specifically, a new transducer dubbed the transducer is introduced that lifts the electrodes away from a piezoelectric resonator by tiny nanometer scale gaps that retain strong electric fields for good electromechanical coupling, while eliminating electrode-derived losses. After removing the electrode losses, the Q of piezoelectric AlN resonators rise by up to 9 times. A new surface-micromachining fabrication process has been developed for the capacitive-piezoelectric resonators, where the metal electrodes are separated from the AlN resonators by small air (or vacuum) gaps. The second approach for tapping the material Q of AlN uses Q-boosting mechanical circuits, where the electrode-equipped AlN resonators are mechanically coupled to electrode-less ones to form a composite-array. In this structure, the energy shared among all of the resonators in the composite-array effectively boost the Q of the electrode-equipped resonators. The Q of electrode-less resonators are extrapolated from the measurement data to be from 14,040 to 15,795. Both methods achieve measured Q exceeding 10,000, posting the highest reported Q for resonators constructed of sputtered AlN and confirming that AlN is indeed a high-Q material.",,,,2,"['https://openalex.org/W1535200054', 'https://openalex.org/W1576836072', 'https://openalex.org/W1916675471', 'https://openalex.org/W1966548041', 'https://openalex.org/W1974168882', 'https://openalex.org/W1979225322', 'https://openalex.org/W1993726349', 'https://openalex.org/W1994115761', 'https://openalex.org/W1995836054', 'https://openalex.org/W1999343861', 'https://openalex.org/W2008449124', 'https://openalex.org/W2016718021', 'https://openalex.org/W2017814565', 'https://openalex.org/W2027321792', 'https://openalex.org/W2027553920', 'https://openalex.org/W2029609207', 'https://openalex.org/W2037771288', 'https://openalex.org/W2057210222', 'https://openalex.org/W2061934614', 'https://openalex.org/W2062107876', 'https://openalex.org/W2067053840', 'https://openalex.org/W2071822903', 'https://openalex.org/W2093729425', 'https://openalex.org/W2094082048', 'https://openalex.org/W2098070562', 'https://openalex.org/W2099649276', 'https://openalex.org/W2100506356', 'https://openalex.org/W2104459526', 'https://openalex.org/W2105130406', 'https://openalex.org/W2105279068', 'https://openalex.org/W2106920353', 'https://openalex.org/W2120648831', 'https://openalex.org/W2126934971', 'https://openalex.org/W2136881173', 'https://openalex.org/W2137186719', 'https://openalex.org/W2139203390', 'https://openalex.org/W2144261285', 'https://openalex.org/W2146351735', 'https://openalex.org/W2158307988', 'https://openalex.org/W2160396987', 'https://openalex.org/W2161497740', 'https://openalex.org/W2164679795', 'https://openalex.org/W2170903083', 'https://openalex.org/W2311727657', 'https://openalex.org/W3144065506']",Hung,,False,

The optical properties of the amorphous TiO2 slab waveguides are studied in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and a propagation loss of < 1 dB/cm at 1.55 micrometer wavelength is measured.

POLYCYCLIC TUFFITE HORIZON IN THE MIOCENE IN VICINITIES OF GLIWICE In the vicinities of Gliwice, western part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, a set of intercalations of pyroclastic rocks, forming a characteristic, polycyclic tuffite horizon, was found in the Miocene section at Ochojec. The stratigraphic analysis of the section showed that the tuffiles occurring in upper part of the Spirialis Clays, about 46 m above the top of the Gypsum Horizon, are of the Badenian age (lower part of the Upper Badenian). The Spirialis Clays yield an assemblage of planktonic microfossils with Spirialis and Globigerina (assemblage III A), characterized by quantitative predominance of pteropods in their lower part and of foraminifers in the upper (Fig. l). The deposits represent equivalents of the Chodenice Beds, described from the vicinities of Wieliczka and Bochnia (S. Alexandrowicz, 1961). In the Gliwice area, the Spirialis Clay are overlain by clays with rich assemblage of benthic foraminifers (assemblage III B), corresponding to the Grabowiec Beds (Fig. 1). The polycyclic tuffite horizon from Ochojec is 15 m thick, including 3.1 m of pyroclastic rocks. In the section, there occur 7 tuffite layers varying in thickness, here marked with symbol s T I – T VII (Fig. 1). Granulometric analysis showed changes in size of pyroclastic material not only within individual tuffite layers but also from the layer T III upwards. The latter changes are connected with gradual decrease in size of the material at the base of successive layers. Microscopic studies carried out on powdered samples showed decrease in share of feldspars, biotite and heavy minerals at the advantage of pumice glass from the layer T III to T VII (Fig. 2, Table I). Chemical analyses of separated volcanic glass, carried out by the classic and atomic absorption methods, showed rhyolite nature of glass present in the studied tuffites. The glass is, however, somewhat poorer in Al 2 O 3 and CaO than rhyolites. The content of SiO 2 in volcanic glass was found to increase from tuffite layer T III to T VII ; the exception is here sample no. P-II from tuffite layer T VI (Table 2). X-ray analyses of the fraction below 0.01 mm, separated from tuffites, showed increase in content of calcium montmorillonite from the layer T I to T VII (Fig. 3, Table 3), which may be explained by progressive increase of content of finer pumice glass. The results of mineralogical and petrographic studies on the tuffites indicate that successive stages of deposition of pyroclastic material were separated by times of deposition of clay material. The first stage of formation of the tuffite complex is represented by tuffites T I and T II the former of which is somewhat more basic than the latter. Tuffite T III yields glass with the lowermost content of silica and, at the same time, pyroclastic material with the highest content of feldspars, biotite and heavy minerals. Tuffites T IV and T V may be regarded as related to T III and, with reference to granulation and mineral and chemical composition of glass, they may be treated as an evidence for decreasingly acid character of volcanic source. The layers T III ­–T V represent the products of the main phase of eruption whereas the layer T VI appears related to eruption more basic in character, evidencing some trend to wanning of the volcanic source. The uppermost tuffite layer, T VII corresponds to a weak eruption and it marks ceasing of volcanic activity responsible for the origin of the whole polycyclic tuffite horizon. An establishment of detailed stratigraphic position of tuffites from Ochojec and of their petrographic nature makes it possible to compare this tuffite horizon with other Miocene pyroclastic rocks. Analogous tuffites are known from several sections of the Upper Badenian in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, especially in the vicinities of Rybnik, Knurow, Gliwice and Kedzierzyn (S. W. Alexandrowicz, 1963). The studied tuffites may be also compared with those from top part of the Chodenice Beds in the vicinities of Wieliczka and Bochnia (W. Parachoniak, 1954; S. Alexandrowicz, 1961) and tuffite horizon from the vicinities of Mielec and Przemyśl (W. Parachoniak, 1962). The horizon is also known from the forefield of the Eastern Carpathians in Ukraine, e.g. from the Verbovec Beds and the base of the Pistyn Conglomerate (O.S. Wialow, 1965; M. Kamienski, 1936). Other occurrences of that horizon may be traced in the forefield of the Eastern Carpathians in Roumania (N. Oncescu, 1959) and in the Transsylvanian Bassin, at inner side of the Carpathian arch (N. Oncescu. 1959; I. Cicha et al., 1975), where these deposits also occur in the Upper Badenian, i.e. Kosovian. In the parts of U.S.S.R., situated behind the Carpathians, analogous tuffite horizon is known to occur in the Banskie Beds (I.V. Venglinskij, 1975). The eastern Slovakia is also situated within the extent of this horizon. A very wide distribution and constant stratigraphic position of the tuffites implicates that it would be reasonable to differentiate it as lithostratigraphic unit with features of a correlative horizon and to name it as “Bochnia tuffite”, selecting the locality from Chelm upon the Raba Rivers (W. W. Parachoniak, 1954; E. Łuczkowska, 1955; S. Alexandrowicz, 1961) as the type locality.",geological quarterly,"['1641-7291', '2082-5099']",journal,4,[],Alexandrowicz,,False,

The required force to forming the material is relatively high, around a few tons. The a-C:H films were applied to reduce the friction coefficient between the surface of the forming tool and the raw material, also generating the possibility of the reduction or elimination of the lubrication applied to the tape surface in the form of zinc phosphate and drawing oil. The samples were produced from AISI M2 steel, using soft machining processes, heat treatment, grinding and polishing with subsequent application of the TiN layer by PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition). To permit comparison, AISI M2 steel without the TiN layer was also used as a substrate. The samples were initially cleaned in ultrasonic baths and subsequently by plasma ablation. Low temperature plasmas of hydrocarbon and noble gas mixtures were used to deposit the films. The hybrid technique of plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID) was used, applying high voltage negative pulses to the samples to promote deposition under ion bombardment. Acetylene (C2H2) diluted in argon was used as the gas mixture for film formation. The effect of the pulse magnitude and plasma pressure on the properties of the films, were studied. Infrared and Raman spectroscopies were employed to evaluate the film chemical composition and microstructure. Via the infrared spectra was observed a decrease in the C-H and O-H band intensities with increasing pulse magnitude, but a rise in the gas pressure caused the intensity of C-H bands to increase. Raman spectra of all the films exhibited strong photoluminescence, indicating a significant hydrogen content. The receptivity of the films to water was analyzed by contact angle ( ) measurements, which revealed a moderate affinity for water ( ~ 80 ) as a consequence of the low concentrations of polar groups on the film surface. The surface topography was determined by profilometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM), while the surface morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Roughness results, measured in Ra, were strongly dependent on the material employed as the substrate: polished AISI M2 steel or AISI M2 steel containing TiN.

The rates of degradation were about 1.8% per year for the G225M and 5.4% per year for the G285M grating relative to the G230L grating. Observations of spectroscopic white dwarf standard stars have shown a decline in sensitivity in the G225M and G285M gratings on the NUV channel, while the gratings with Al+MgF2 coatings (G230L and G185M) appear stable. The trends seen in external targets confirm those seen using internal exposures, and appear to be wavelength-independent but grating dependent. All gratings on the FUV channel are experiencing wavelength-dependent sensitivity degradation, which is worse at longer wavelengths. At the shortest FUV wavelengths the sensitivity decline is around 5% per year, increasing to about 12%/year at 1800 u The sensitivity changes on the NUV and FUV channels appear to be uncoupled. The sensitivity decline of the NUV bare Al gratings appears to be caused by continued growth of an oxide layer, either from additional deposition of atomic oxygen in space or migration of existing atomic oxygen in the system to the outside. Detector QE loss due to localized exposure of the FUV cross-delay line detector to UV irradiation can be ruled out by several tests which examine the sensitivity decline versus total counts in specific regions of the detector. The wavelength dependence of the FUV sensitivity degradation is the opposite sense for contamination to be an issue. The source of the FUV sensitivity decline does not appear to be due to shifts in the pulse-height distribution from gain sag.

Most of these processes take place at the surface of a metal, such as for example layer growth and corrosion phenomena or all catalytic applications. X-ray absorption spectroscopy is one of the most important investigation tools in this context. It allows resolving the local structure around a selected kind of element in the probed sample within the range of a few Angstroms by using the intense X-ray beams generated at modern synchrotron radiation sources. It is thus perfectly adapted to investigate systems with only a short range order as for example very thin layers or nanoparticles which are especially important for catalytic applications. Prerequisite for X-ray absorption spectroscopy are monochromators with perfect crystals that reflect only a certain energy determined by the incident angle. Time-resolutions of down to a few milliseconds for one spectrum are achievable with quick-scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy (QEXAFS) using mechanics to rapidly oscillate the monochromator crystals.
 New technical approaches for the QEXAFS method are presented in this work as for example an angular encoder system to accurately measure the monochromator crystal angle and thus to obtain most accurate energy values for the measured spectra. The design of flexible driving mechanics is introduced and tested. The new mechanics allow arbitrarily adjusting the energy range of the spectra within few seconds leading to a more efficient application of QEXAFS and also new possible experiments. Moreover, a new fast and reliable data acquisition system is presented as well as new user-friendly data analysis software named T-REX to handle the thousands of spectra that are typically collected during each measurement.
 Several applications in the field of catalysis are presented where new insights in dynamic processes could be obtained using quick-scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Pd-catalyzed Heck reaction was studied as well as stable oscillations during the catalytic partial oxidation of methane on Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts, the oxidation and reduction behaviour of Cu/Al 2 O 3 catalysts at various temperatures and structural oscillations during the extinction of CO oxidation on a Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Thereby, new data analysis approaches were introduced, as for example a median filter to analyze distorted data resulting from unstable sample conditions and modulation spectroscopy to improve signal-to-noise ratios for processes that can be reproducibly excited by tuning the experimental parameters. As an example for chemical decomposition processes it is reported on QEXAFS studies of the dehydration and decomposition of cobalt oxalates in reducing, oxidizing and inert atmosphere. Finally, data measured in-situ in reflection mode with sub-second time-resolution during the deposition of copper on glass via DC magnetron sputtering are shown yielding new insights in the initial stages of the layer growth processes under realistic deposition conditions. Subsequent oxidation of the fresh Cu layers at various substrate temperatures was also investigated and the obtained results demonstrate the high potential of using QEXAFS to gain new insights into fundamental processes in surface science.",,,,2,[],Stötzel,,False,

Though the list of hybrid layered materials is long and despite the fact that most of the components used in this investigation are based on well-known precursors, this dissertation illustrates how there are still vast domains in this field that remain unexplored.
The first part of the thesis deals with hybrid magnetic multilayers made out of cyanide-based networks and layered double hydroxide solid-state hosts. Though both components have been exhaustively studied in the past, this work describes the unprecedented in situ confined growth of a cyanide network within the basal galleries of LDHs. The growth of the cyanide-based magnets within a diamagnetic LDH allows for the confirmation that the confining effect provokes a downshift of the critical temperature in comparison with the 3-D analogue. Following, the same strategy was employed to attempt the growth of bimetallic cyanides within magnetic LDHs as the host architecture. Yet, in this case the divalent metal acts as a scavenging agent, drawing the precursor hexcyanometalate out of the LDH galleries. The system so obtained may be better described as a nanoparticle/ nanolayer composite combining the magnetic properties of the pristine LDH and Cr-Ni Prussian blue analogue (PBA).
The second part explores the chemistry and physics of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Chapter 2 provides with an in-depth insight into the experimental detail of the synthesis of neutral TMDCs as polycrystalline and single crystalline materials. The intercalation reaction with simple alkali metals is then looked into in preparation for the following chapters where Na- intercalates are used as precursors of multifunctional hybrid materials.
In this line, Chapter 3 is devoted to the synthesis of a mixed solid-state/ molecule based material that combines superconductivity with single-molecule magnetism (SMM). This is achieved by delaminating pristine NaxTaS2 in solution to form stable nanosheet sols that could be conveniently re-stacked together in the presence of Mn4 cationic SMMs. An in-depth analysis performed by SQUID magnetometry permits identifying a transition to the superconducting state at around 4 K and Arrhenius type relaxation of the out of phase component of the AC susceptibility coming from the inserted molecules.
In addition, Chapter 4 demonstrates the general applicability of the delamination/flocculation technique with TMDCs by the isolation of a further hybrid material this time combining spin crossover (SCO) mono-nuclear complexes with the intrinsic superconducting properties of the TaS2 layers. On the basis of magnetic measurements and Mossbauer spectroscopy, it is confirmed that the low temperature transition to the Meissner state gives way to a gradual spin equilibrium up to 400 K.
The final part of the work is motivated by the vast experience acquired in the exfoliation of TMDCs. In this context research was devoted to the isolation of single or few layer TaS2 flakes. Since the exfoliation techniques in solution afford generally defective layers with small surface areas, the field of the all-dry exfoliation methods is explored. A variation of the micro-mechanical method is developed allowing to deposit atomically thin patches of TaS2 in a variety of substrates. The deposition of such specimens on a Si/SiO2 surface opens the door for the fabrication of single-flake devices and for the first time, superconductivity is observed in an exfoliated atomically thin layer. The final chapter shows how these TaS2 layered may be chemically modified to construct Ta2O5/TaS2 bi-dimensional patterns via atomic force microscopy-local oxidation nanolithography (AFM- LON).",,,,1,[],Moratalla,,False,

Nickel micrometer-scale dots of 10μm width and 250 nm height nickel structure were deposited with different concentrations of electrochemical deposition solution. A positive potential was applied to a gold electrode integrated in the AFM cantilever and a negative potential was applied to a conductive substrate. The Au electrode on the AFM cantilever becomes an anode and substrate becomes a cathode. By applying a bias between a copper substrate and the Au electrode on the AFM cantilever, a strong electric field was generated at the limited area. And the localized electric field resulted in significant migration effect. This migration effect is the major factor of the localized electrochemical deposition (LECD) at substrate under the electrode of AFM cantilever. To verify the effect of migration and diffusion on electrochemical reaction, computational simulation was performed before localized electrochemical deposition experiment. In the localized electrochemical deposition process, bulk concentration, applied potential and distance between the substrate and electrode are the major parameters affecting migration and the diffusion of ions in the electroplating solution. The electrochemical reaction was analyzed by computational calculation. In the LECD simulation processes, electric field between the electrodes and size of the electrode determined the localized printed geometry. As the electrode approaches the substrate, stronger and more localized electric field is generated from the anode electrode. This electric field is determined by the bias and the distance of between anode and cathode. To generate constant electric field between anode and cathode, the distance of electrode and substrate should be fixed. In this localized electrochemical deposition process, we used the AFM cantilever integrated with an ultramicroelectrode fabricated from a conventional AFM cantilever using subsequent metallization and insulation layer deposition processes, as well as final FIB milling process exposing the micrometer scale electrode at a fixed distance from the tip apex.

The system consists of Au nanoparticles separated from an Fe(001) back electrode by a crystalline ultra-thin NaCl film. Due to the small size of the nanoparticles (3.5 nm high), the Coulomb blockade can be observed at room temperature. An atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever is used as a movable gate to charge individual nanoparticles via single-electron tunneling from the back electrode. At the same time the tunneling is detected by measuring frequency shift and damping of the oscillating cantilever. The e-EFM technique can overcome limitations of other characterization methods based on lithographic fabrication. So far, however, it has been successfully used only at low-temperatures. In this work, we extend the e-EFM technique to room temperature by carefully tuning the sample design and fabrication relative to the cantilever response to achieve maximum sensitivity. To grow atomically defined tunnel barriers we investigate the morphology of MgO and NaCl ultra-thin films on Fe(001) surfaces by non-contact-AFM and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). First, we demonstrate that the quality of MgO films, typically grown in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) by electron-beam evaporation, can be improved by using reactive deposition method that gives full control over the gaseous species existing in the evaporated beam. Second, we investigate the effects of temperature and oxygen presence on the growth of NaCl on Fe(001). As a result, we develop a protocol to grow NaCl films on the Fe(001)-p(1x1)O surface in a layer-by-layer mode, yielding atomically flat films with 40-60 nm wide terraces (on a 12 ML thick film) and with far fewer defects than the MgO films. Using the NaCl film as a tunnel barrier that can be easily adjusted by modifying the film thickness we characterize single-electron charging at room temperature of individual Au nanoparticles formed after thermal evaporation onto a 6 monolayer thick NaCl film. We demonstrate how a combination of e-EFM and finite element electrostatic simulation can be used for revealing electronic and morphological properties of individual Au nanoparticles. As a result, the electron addition energy, the capacitance, tunneling rates and an approximated shape of an individual nanoparticle have been determined. Numerical simulations point towards a total capacitance dominated by the mutual capacitance between the nanoparticle and the back electrode. A comparison with the experimental value, determined from measurement of the addition energy, indicates that the nanoparticles should be modeled as truncated spheres in order to reduce the mutual capacitance to the substrate.

The Pb-Te electrochemical system was investigated to determine the optimal conditions for deposition. It was found that citric acid complexed tellurium in solution shifting its reduction potential cathodically. The shift in reduction potential led to the deposition of pure PbTe without any observable excess tellurium. Nanowires of PbTe were doped p-type and n-type through the addition of thallium and indium to the plating solution. Indium-doped nanowire arrays showed a linear relation between lattice parameter and atomic percent indium confirming successful incorporation. The lattice parameter trend in thallium-doped nanowire arrays was linear only after annealing. In the case of thallium doping, thallium tellurides were formed, which upon annealing formed a solid solution with PbTe. The results of the thallium doping study led to the investigation of the Tl-Te electrochemical system. Cyclic voltammagrams were used to determine the deposition mechanism of TlTe and Tl5Te3. Thin films and nanowire arrays of these compounds were deposited. This was the first study of the electrochemical Tl-Te system and the first report of the electrodeposition of TlTe and Tl5Te3. Thermoelectric measurements were conducted on thin films and nanowire arrays of PbTe. The Seebeck coefficient and resistivity of PbTe thin film were measured. Results from thin films were complicated by the Pt substrate on which PbTe was deposited. Subtracting the effects of the Pt layer suggested PbTe thin films could have a large zT, however further work is needed to confirm this result. Resistivity measurements on nanowire arrays were also conducted. Despite efforts to minimize the oxidation of PbTe nanowires, good electrical contacts could not be created. The resistivity of nanowire arrays were orders of magnitude higher than expected. As a result of their low conductivity, the thermoelectric efficiency of PbTe nanowires were negliglable. Nanotube arrays of conductive polyaniline were synthesized through the electrochemical deposition into porous anodic alumina. PbTe nanowires were deposited into these nanotubes to create a PbTe/polyaniline core-shell structure. PbTe/polyaniline hybrids should have a lower thermal conductivity than pure PbTe. Measurements of PbTe/polyaniline core-shell nanowires are still needed to confirm the predicted lower thermal conductivity.",,,,1,[],Hillman,,False,

The outcome will potentially contribute to knowledge that will facilitate the repair of the articular surface of cartilage where degradation is limited to the loss of the lipids of the SAL only. The surface amorphous layer is of utmost importance to the effective load-spreading, lubrication, and semipermeability (which controls its fluid management, nutrient transport and waste removal) of articular cartilage in the mammalian joints. However, because this uppermost layer of cartilage is often in contact during physiological function, it is prone to wear and tear, and thus, is the site for damage initiation that can lead to the early stages of joint condition like osteoarthritis, and related conditions that cause pain and discomfort leading to low quality of life in patients. It is therefore imperative to conduct a study which offers insight into remedying this problem.

It is hypothesized that restoration (resurfacing) of the surface amorphous layer can be achieved by re-introducing synthetic surface-active phospholipids (SAPL) into the joint space. This hypothesis was tested in this thesis by exposing cartilage samples whose surface lipids had been depleted to individual and mixtures of synthetic saturated and unsaturated phospholipids. The surfaces of normal, delipidized, and relipidized samples of cartilage were characterized for their structural integrity and functionality using atomic force microscope (AFM), confocal microscope (COFM), Raman spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with image processing in the MATLAB® environment and mechanical loading experiments. The results from AFM imaging, confocal microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy revealed a successful deposition of new surface layer on delipidized cartilage when incubated in synthetic phospholipids. The relipidization resulted in a significant improvement in the surface nanostructure of the artificially degraded cartilage, with the complete SAPL mixture providing better outcomes in comparison to those created with the single SAPL components (palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, POPC and dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, DPPC).

MRI analysis revealed that the surface created with the complete mixture of synthetic lipids was capable of providing semipermeability to the surface layer of the treated cartilage samples relative to the normal intact surface. Furthermore, deformation energy analysis revealed that the treated samples were capable of delivering the elastic properties required for load bearing and recovery of the tissue relative to the normal intact samples, with this capability closer between the normal and the samples incubated in the complete lipid mixture.

In conclusion, this thesis has established that it is possible to deposit/create a potentially viable layer on the surface of cartilage following degradation/lipid loss through incubation in synthetic lipid solutions. However, further studies will be required to advance the ideas developed in this thesis, for the development of synthetic lipid-based injections/drugs for treatment of osteoarthritis and other related joint conditions.",science & engineering faculty,,journal,1,[],Yusuf,,False,

The aim of this research was to enlarge knowledge and improve methods on the formation of ultra-high resolution structures. Research sub-projects were defined to focus on specific aspects of ultra-high resolution lithography. The results of these sub-projects form the basis of this thesis.

After a short introduction to the principles of lithography, the key points to high resolution technology and the scope of the thesis (Chapter 1), Chapter 2 summarizes the most outstanding and successful attempts performed so far by researchers in the field to improve parameters influencing the lithographic process to achieve formation of ultimately small features at the highest density. The purpose of Chapter 2 is to give reader an understanding of complexity of the lithography process and to give insight into variable ways how to optimize. Therefore the emphasis is given to the experimental results on optimization of each lithography step. First, results on different methods of beam quantification and optimization of crucial parameters in the exposure system are presented. Next, the various tricks to optimise the lithographic process during resist treatments and post-exposure steps as well as during the most important steps – exposure, development and drying are discussed. The last part of this chapter focuses on experimental results of exposure of inorganic resist materials and exposure using ultra thin resist layers as exponents of ultimate resolution.

The thesis research started with establishing a quantitative picture of the high resolution electron beam exposure process in ultra thin hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist layers. These results are presented in Chapter 3. Three important contributions to quantitative electron beam patterning in the 2-10 nm regime are considered. First of all, electron beam measurements with an advanced knife-edge structure described in this chapter pointed to a minimum e-beam diameter of approximately ~3.9 nm in our lithography system, to be compared with the theoretical estimate of 3 nm. Then, it was demonstrated that adjustment of the beam focus by erroneous beam optimisation due to aging in the marker performance accounts for a broadening of smallest features up to about 3 nm. Additionally the linewidth broadening of about 13 nm in comparing ‘thin’ (5 nm) and ‘thick’ (50 nm) resist layers is attributed to a different density in the secondary electron (SE) exposure of the resist. The combined results provided a quantitative picture of limiting factors for the achievement of ultimate resolution.

In chapter 4 the impact of resist thickness on the resolution performance of HSQ electron beam resist is investigated. Thickness of the resist layer was found to have a substantial influence on sensitivity, contrast and surface morphology. Dependence of electron cascade processes on thickness was shown to contribute to the variation of the resist sensitivity and the consequent linewidth broadening with increase of resist thickness. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were used to get an insight into the exposure process and the energy transfer to the resist. The results of the MC modeling were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results and the proposed mechanism on sensitivity loss and structure linewidth broadening with increase of resist thickness. The molecular cluster size was shown to increase significantly with smaller resist thickness which enhances the surface roughness for ultra thin resist layers. Vacuum drying of resist films was demonstrated to result in smoothening of the resist surface, while it had no strong influence on the ultra high resolution patterning capability of HSQ resist.

In Chapter 5, the influence of the exposure temperature on the performance of HSQ resist in ultra high resolution electron beam lithography was investigated. Dependencies of the HSQ contrast and sensitivity with respect to the temperature during exposure were obtained. Besides the increase of sensitivity at elevated temperature up to 90 oC, a slight degradation of the contrast was observed with exposure temperature rise. An activation energy ~1.6 kcal/mol was obtained from the linear region of the Arrhenius plot of the sensitivity vs. temperature. It was shown that ultra high resolution structures formed at elevated temperatures exhibit improved uniformity in combination with less sensitivity to overdose. The observed effects were attributed to several mechanisms. Amplification of thermally activated processes and their influence on the the resist sensitivity and molecular weight distributions between original and irradiated resists was proposed as the main mechanism which determines contrast and consequent resist resolution with exposure temperature variation. Complementary to the main mechanism, a slight decrease of diffusion range of SE and a decrease of structure’s porosity with a rise of exposure temperature due to enhanced cross linking could take place.

In Chapter 6 a method for improving the aspect ratio of ultrahigh-resolution structures in negative electron-beam resist is provided. The idea of this method is formation of a protective “cap” on top of the resist structure by means of electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID) in a self-aligned approach. This way the pattern transfer capabilities maybe enhanced. The process is implemented by a combination of electron-beam lithography and EBID during exposure of the resist material in the presence of a precursor gas. As the result, aspect ratios up to 20% and 14 % higher were obtained for Pt precursor (methylcyclopentadienyl(trimethyl)platinum) and TEOS precursor, respectively. It was shown that the absolute feature-height improvement achieved by means of EBL+EBID compared to conventional EBL is most prominent for thicker resist layers. This effect was related to an enhanced development speed in thicker layers. Tungsten precursor showed no aspect ratio improvement at all. It was demonstrated that erosion of the deposited cap material during development is a serious drawback. It was concluded that the combined EBL+EBID method requires further optimization, whereby the type and flux of precursor gas, the process temperature, and the developer conditions (strength, composition) are the most important parameters.

Chapter 7 deals with an investigation of the lithographic process with a scanning sub-nanometer helium ion beam. The lithographic performance of both the positive tone poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and the negative tone HSQ resist were studied. It was demonstrated that the scanning He+ ion beam has a very high resolution (down to 6±1 nm features in HSQ). Additionally, superior low proximity effect as compared to electron beam exposure was demonstrated. It enabled the formation of extreme high-density features down to pitch of 14 nm in HSQ resist. Furthermore, He+ ion exposure was shown to be several times more effective than electron beam exposure at the same acceleration voltage, whereas the contrast was found to be almost equal. HSQ and PMMA resists exhibited respectively 4 and 17 times higher sensitivities for helium ions than for electrons at the same energy of 30 keV. Dependence of sensitivity on He+ ions energy was found to correlate with the electronic stopping power of ions in resist. Overall, He+ ion beam lithography was shown as a very promising technique for the formation of ultrahigh resolution structures of a high density and having feature sizes far into the sub-10-nm range.

In chapter 8, the response of Al2O3 material to bombardment with He+ ions and consequent development was investigated and partly compared to lithographic behavior of WO3. Positive tone and negative tone resist behavior after alkaline development was observed for Al2O3 depending on the exposure dose. Observed lithographic behavior of Al2O3 was ascribed to the role of the material density, structural order and defects influencing the solubility of Al2O3 during development. Exposure to He+ ions does not reduce Al2O3 to metallic state contrary to the heavier atomic weight transition metal oxide WO3. Sub-surface bubbles were not observed after He+ ion beam exposure within investigated dose range. Finally, sub-10-nm patterning of Al2O3 was demonstrated in a negative tone exposure mode.

In conclusion, the results presented in this thesis demonstrate several ways of optimizing the lithographic process to ultimate performance. Optimization of the lithographic system, exposure of resists at elevated temperatures, utilization of ultra thin layers, combination of EBL and EBID, exposure of several resist materials with helium ion beam were undertaken. Successful outcome of each step brought additional understanding of the ultra-high resolution lithographic process together with a number of useful findings, which make patterning of sub-10-nm structures at high density more feasible.",,,,6,[],Sidorkin,,False,

The spin of the electrons is used as an additional degree of freedom in contrast to common electronic devices. The main constituent of many spintronic devices is the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) where two ferromagnets are separated by a thin insulating tunnel barrier. The resistance of such a device depends on the magnetic orientation of the ferromagnets. Usually, R_AP (antiparallel) is higher than R_P (parallel) and a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) can be defined as TMR = R_AP-R_P / R_P. For small voltages the resistance is connected to the spin dependent density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level of the ferromagnets. Hence, the TMR value is also given by TMR = (2 P1 P2) / (1-P1 P2) with the spin polarization P1,2.
Therefore, materials with a high spin polarization are eligible for applications. A half metallic behavior, i.e., they are 100 percent spin polarized at the Fermi level E_F which has been theoretically predicted for some oxide compounds such as Fe3O4 and CrO2, perovskites (e.g. LaSrMnO3), zinc-blende-type CrAs and Heusler compounds. In particular, Co-based Heusler compounds are promising materials for spintronic applications due to the required high Curie temperatures T_C. Here a Heusler compound is given by the composition X2YZ and a crystallographic L2_1 structure exists. X and Y are transition metal elements and Z is a group III, IV or V element.
In 2004, room temperature TMR ratios of more than 100 percent were reported for MgO-based MTJs. Recently Ikeda presented TMR ratios of over 600 percent at room temperature and over 1100 percent at low temperatures for a single MgO tunnel barrier. With the concept of a double barrier system these values can be increased and TMR ratios of more than 1000 percent at room temperature have been reported.
High room temperature TMR ratios have also been reported for MTJs containing Heusler compounds as electrodes: 217 percent for Co2MnSi and very recently 386 percent for Co2Fe0.5Al0.5Si. The latter was grown by using molecular beam epitaxy in place of sputtering deposition. However, sputtering is the preferred and established method for industrial applications. From a technological point of view, the aim is also to achieve high TMR ratios by sputtering. The actuality of this topic can by recognized by recent press releases. For example, Toshiba announced the development of a spin transport electronics based metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) cell with a full Heusler compound. However, the predicted half-metallicity for Heusler compounds should lead to much higher TMR ratios.
Nevertheless, one has to meet two challenges to achieve half metallicity: 
1. crystallization of the Heusler electrode(s) in L2_1 structure 
2. coherent interfaces of the Heusler compound and the MgO tunnel barrier
In this work we have investigated different Co-based Heusler compounds. We have integrated them into so called half junctions to investigate the crystal growth and magnetic properties of the Heusler electrode and into full MTJs for the transport properties.
We describe the optimization of a required seed layer system to induce the preferred (001) texture of the Heusler thin films. Furthermore, we have optimized the Heusler layer in an attempt to achieve a high atomic ordering, represented by a high magnetic moment and a maximum (001) texture. We investigated the transport properties of the full junctions at room temperature and low temperature (13K) respectively, and discuss them in terms of annealing temperature, bias voltage and temperature dependence.
Finally, the industrial applicability and integration of Heusler compound electrodes into conventional GMR/TMR systems will be verified. Consequently, Heusler junctions prepared by Singulus NDT GmbH will be compared to our samples. In particular, the growth properties of the Heusler layer will be addressed to determine differences within the sputtering process of the Heusler thin films.",,,,3,[],Ebke,,False,

Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is a ferrimagnetic insulator which is called the spin Seebeck insulator, for its supports of pure spin currents generation. Non-magnetic metals (NM) with strong spin-orbit interaction (e.g. Pd, Pt), are used as either spin current generator or detector based on the spin Hall effect (SHE) or the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The combination of these two types of material plays a very important role in spintronics. One the other hand, a recent magneto-transport study shows strong evidence of a magnetic proximity effect in thin Pt films deposited on YIG. It is desirable to have more experimental evidence in distinguishing the two effects qualitatively and quantitatively. In my work here, the induced magneto-transport effects at NM/MI interface will be discussed in details, including induced independent spin moments at the interface and disentanglement of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), as well as the fabrication of YIG thin films and devices.Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has emerged as a preferred technique to deposit complex oxide thin films, heterostructures, and superlattices with high quality. The general PLD techniques will be discussed in Chapter I, with examples of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and Fe3O4 thin films fabrication and characterization. In Chapter II, I will discuss our approach to grow YIG films on (110)- and (111)-oriented gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates. In both orientations, we have successfully grown epitaxial YIG thin films confirmed by the patterns of the reflection high-energy electron diffraction. The layer-by-layer mode was achieved with lower laser repetition rate than reported by other groups. For both orientations, the atomic force microscopy images showed that the YIG surface was extremely flat, and flat terraces were found with the atomic step height on film surface. The magnetic properties were measured with in-plane easy-axis and very narrow coercive field, which was almost independent of temperature. The in-plane magnetic anisotropy was explored as well. This work paves the way to engineering anisotropy of the thin films for YIG-based magnetic devices.As a thin layer of NM (e.g. Pd, Pt) was deposited on the MI thin film like YIG, NM developed both low- and high-field magneto-transport effects that were absent in standalone NM or thick NM on YIG. While the low-field magnetoresistance (MR) peaks of NM tracked the coercive field of the YIG film, the much larger high-field MR and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE-like) did not appear to have any relationship with the bulk YIG magnetization. The high-field MR had a sign reversal at some intermediate temperature for both Pd and Pt, and the magnitude of AHE-like signal of Pd increased with decreasing temperature, while that of Pt had sign reversal. The distinct high-field magneto-transport effects in NM/MI structures had been investigated with different NM film thickness and some control samples, and were shown to be caused by interfacial local moments in NM. Besides, both a clear resistivity minimum and a ln(T) temperature dependence were observed at low temperatures in thin NM films, suggesting that the Kondo effect may be relevant. Detailed discussions about the origin of these effects will be presented in Chapter III.The AMR effect, evidence for a proximity induced magnetic moment in Pt/YIG bilayer, was previously found absent in experiments with a rotating magnetic field applied at room temperature. Instead, the observed magnetoresistance was attributed to a new type of effect called SMR that is caused by magnetization-dependent spin current reflection at the interface. In both Pd/YIG and Pt/YIG bilayers, however, we have observed that SMR and AMR coexist over a wide range of temperatures with AMR dominating at low temperatures. Detailed experimental results were shown of the temperature dependence and field dependence of the two types of magnetoresistance, to disentangle AMR and SMR quantitatively. While AMR is likely caused by the proximity induced magnetization in NM that saturates at relatively low fields, at higher magnetic fields when additional interfacial magnetic moments are gradually aligned, the spin current reflection effect and consequently SMR are greatly enhanced. The detailed analysis and discussions will be presented in Chapter IV.",,,,1,[],Lin,,False,

In this perspective, bulk materials properties and biomechanics took relevance in view of the stringent mechanical and tribological demands of the bio-implants. However, such issues cannot be the sole determinants of clinical outcome. Interest in bulk properties has inevitably shifted to the important consideration of the surface with the interfacial phenomena, conditioning their performance. These events are extremely important for biosensor devices. The application focus of biosensors has also broadened with time and whilst clinical diagnostics probably remains the single biggest area, roles are also being found in environmental (including food) monitoring, personal security (including warfare), drug discovery, and basic biological research. The development of suitable materials for biosensor applications requires a thorough understanding of the structure and chemistry of the solid-liquid interface when such a material has to work in the actual context. The research domain is complex due to the diversity of materials and applications of interest and the variety of biological species the biosensor device has to interface. In order to begin to follow the interactions that may occur when a material is placed in a particular environment, it is of fundamental importance to have information on the composition and structure of the top few atomic layers. In general, the statement that surface properties of a material differ from that of the bulk can be also applied to biomaterials. Thus, since the interaction between the material and the biological species occur at their interface, that is at molecular level in a narrow interface zone (< 1 nm), the surface properties of the material can greatly influence the biomaterial tissue/cell/protein interaction. Surface modification techniques have become a key method for designing materials to produce specific biological and chemical interactions. Modification of surface properties by altering the surface functionalities or by thin film deposition allow us to create and optimize surfaces with desired chemical and physical properties suitable for subsequent biological evaluation and indeed, for such applications as the promotion of specific cell/protein responses to a surface. Nowadays, the wet chemical conventional methods, used for surface functionalization, involve in some cases the use of toxic liquid reagents thus environment detrimental; for this reason they are progressively being replaced by other techniques, in particular by plasma surface modification processes. Low-temperature plasmas are produced by electrical discharge sustained by gases at low-pressure condition. They consist of a mixture of highly reactive species, i.e., ions, radicals, electrons, photons and excited molecules. The nature of plasmas, the modalities of transferring electric or electromagnetic field intensities to the reaction systems, the geometry of reactor (shape and volumes of the reaction vessel, geometrical location of electrodes and substrates, etc.) and the selected experimental conditions (pressure, power, flow rates of gases, temperature of the substrates, etc.) crucially influence the gas-phase and surface-related plasma chemistry. Recently, surface treatments and modification based on vapor phase plasma-assisted techniques have been widely applied to several biomedical fields. These processes are able to provide specific mono-type chemical functionalities, exposed at materials surfaces. Respect to traditional liquid phase procedures, advantages such as the high process control and the use of small quantities of reagents, are crucial for the enhancement of efficiency of the interactions that materials must perform according to the application. In particular, procedures for in situ plasma polymerization, starting from vapor released by liquid monomers, are presently used to synthesize innovative polymeric thin films applicable as substrates for cell culture, as adhesion promoter in prosthetic implants and for molecular recognition in sensors and biosensors. This method achieves the chemical and morphological modification of surfaces leaving the bulk properties practically intact, thus enabling its applicability to a great variety of materials independently from their chemical properties. By plasma treatment completely different chemistry, hydrophilicity or surface roughness can be obtained in final resulting materials. Advantages of plasma polymerization include the possibility to obtain conformal thin films, pinhole free, deposited on most substrates, by means of a relatively simple one-step coating. Additionally, a wide range of compounds can be chosen as a monomer for plasma polymerization, even saturated hydrocarbons, providing a great diversity of possible surface modifications. Among these compounds, Acrylic Acid is an important monomer, finding applications as a coating in a great number of biological experiments, for example, as a novel cell-delivery vehicle. Using acrylic acid as a monomer for plasma polymerization, layers, containing carboxylic acid groups (-COOH), can be produced to make surfaces reactive towards different biomolecules containing amino groups (NH2). In this kind of applications the density of the carboxylic functionalities exposed at the surface of the plasma polymer is a crucial point. The modulation of the applied power, typically through variation of the pulse frequency and duty cycle, enables greater control over the processing plasma properties, for instance, the retention of the degree of monomer functional groups in the resulting polymer structure.. It worth of note that, by selectively acting the monomer fragmentation, through the plasma discharge pulsing, it is possible to promote the chain propagation of the polymer without affecting the chemical structure of the functional groups and so obtaining a high density of reactive surface species. These advantages have resulted in the rapid development of plasma technology, during the past decades, for applications ranging from adhesion to composite materials, protective coatings, printing, membranes, biomedical applications and so on. 1) Concerning the first part of the experimental work of this thesis, a twofold aim can be singled out: • by means of the study and the optimization of plasma polymerization processes, the achievement of thin films exposing the desired properties of stability, biocompatibility and bioreactivity • the experimental validation of such films performance in biosensor devices For these purposes, thin functional films deposited by plasma-polymerization process, were applied to different devices, in particular a plasma poly-acrylic acid thin film was used for the surface functionalization of a Microarray platform for biodiagnostic detection analysis. Then, a patterned functional polymer obtained by the combination of a non-bio-adhesive layer of plasma poly-styrene and the functional coating of the plasma poly acrylic acid, was used for the functionalization of a photonic mono-dimensional crystal able to couple Bloch Surface Waves on its surface to Fluorescence emission specifically localized to poly-acrylic acid guides for photonic biosensing . 2) A last chapter of this thesis is dedicated to the study and optimization of maleic anhydride functionalization according to different technical approaches, compared in terms of technical feasibility and achievable surface properties, in order to obtain a stable surface functionalization with a sufficient anhydride density for subsequent protein binding",,,,4,[],Ricciardi,,False,

Take up of such devices, especially for building integrated applications BIPV, is hampered by long-term degradation of efficiency due to water ingress through the barrier layer defects to the CIGS modules causing electrical shorts and efficiency drops. To address this problem a thin (~40nm) barrier coating of Al2O3 usually provides the environmental protection for the PV cells. The highly conformal aluminium oxide barrier layer is produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The presentation reports initial measurement and characterisation of prototype films. Characterisation is based on the application of segmentation analysis and where the film is considered to be a special case structured surface and defects are considered as structural elements. Characterisation then allows the correlation of water vapour transmission with defect density to be addressed. The paper also reports on a new in process, high speed, environmentally robust optical interferometer instrument developed to detect defects on the polymer film during manufacture. These results provide the basis for the development of R2R in process metrology devices",,,,0,[],Blunt,,False,

The present work demonstrates such principles using the model case of methylene blue photooxidation over thin-film anatase TiO2 grown by atomic layer deposition. The near-surface electric field was controlled by tuning the space charge layer width through varying the bulk carrier concentration and the surface potential. The carrier concentration in the polycrystalline semiconductor was controlled over a range of 2.5 orders of magnitude via an unconventional method - film thickness, which indirectly influenced the concentration of electrically active donor defects at grain boundaries, through which the reaction rate constant varied by about a factor of 5. The surface potential of the TiO2 was controlled by treating the surface with remote oxygen plasma, changing the surface Fermi level by as much as 0.4 V through which the reaction rate constant varied by about 35%. Both trends are well-described by a quantitative one-dimensional model for photocurrent. The model suggests that changes in rate result fundamentally from variations in the width of the space charge layer near the surface. Electrical characterization of the films by capacitance-voltage measurements and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, together with detailed physical characterization by a variety of other

The XPS measurements were carried out at BESSY II in Berlin with primary energies of 150 eV and 640 eV and the EELS measurements were done with a primary energy of 50 eV. We measured the O1s, Si2p core level and the valence band including the Hf 4f core level. From the Hf4f to Si2p ratios taken at each energy we developed a growth model for the first monolayer and for the following layers too. From our data we conclude, that in the first monolayer up to the fourth ALD cycle an island growth occurs. The height of these islands is about 0,5nm. After the first monolayer is completed, a layer- by-layer growth can be expected. In order to proof this observation we have simulated the Hf/Si ratio for different excitation energies and found a very good agreement with our measurement data.

This methodology has been successfully applied at JPL to produce patterned and coated silicon nanotips (also known as black silicon) to manipulate the hydrophilicity of surfaces to direct the spreading of fluids in microdevices. JPL s ALD technique is an ideal method to produce the highly conformal coatings required for this type of application. Certain materials, such as TiO2, have germicidal and anti-fouling properties when they are illuminated with UV light. The proposed delivery device contacts medicine with this high-surface-area black silicon surface coated with a thin-film germicidal deposited conformally with ALD.

The ability to modify and alter their pore size and dimensions, along with the physical and chemical properties of the material that constitute these pores make them highly sensitive to such applications, particularly protein separation. Our study investigated the use of titania modified porous anodic alumina (AAO) membranes. Titania was deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) for different number of cycles in order to generate membranes with reduced poresizes ranging from 100nm-10nm. Protein permeation experiments using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Lysozyme (Lys) were conducted to show selectivity in transport and separation of the proteins. Transport occurred by diffusion and a subsequent decrease in flow rate was observed with decrease in pore size of the membranes. In addition, the use of titania modified AAO membranes demonstrated minimal extent of non-specific absorption of proteins along the pores during permeation when subject to UV radiation. The resultant titania coated AAO membranes achieved controlled reduction of pore size using ALD and are thus, applicable for advanced protein transport, separation and catalysis.","chemeca 2011: engineering a better world: sydney hilton hotel, nsw, australia, 18-21 september 2011",,journal,0,"['https://openalex.org/W2002227273', 'https://openalex.org/W2035879333', 'https://openalex.org/W2071633657', 'https://openalex.org/W2129779013', 'https://openalex.org/W2132779596', 'https://openalex.org/W2150558027', 'https://openalex.org/W2157254946', 'https://openalex.org/W2168031077', 'https://openalex.org/W576610794']",Nambiar,,False,

In the past, after gate dielectric deposition, the annealing process with nitrogen gas was commonly adopted to repair the existence of defects in gate dielectric and therefore improve the quality of interfacial layer in MOSFETs. However, few published researches discussed the nitridation effect of decoupled plasma nitridation (DPN) process with the hot-carrier effect and electrical characteristics at different annealing temperatures. In this study, I focus on these points and try to establish these relationships.
 In this work, the tested 28nm wafers came from UMC. The hafnium-based gate dielectric with a profile of HfOx/ZrOy/HfOz (HZH) was deposited with atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology. The experimental parameters include the different channel lengths and stress temperatures. Consequently, through the statistical and analytical analysis of experimental data, the nitridation effect with annealing temperatures reflecting the various results of device electrical characteristics are exposed in this thesis. 
After the analysis, the annealing temperatures after DPN treatments do not obviously impact the device performance. Owing to the stronger horizontal electrical field, the degradation of short channel nMOSFETs with L=0.03?m in channel hot-carrier (CHC) stress is more serious than that with L=1?m.

With funding awarded by the EU's Seventh Framework programme, this project seeks to develop integrated process inspection, cleaning, repair and control systems for nano-scale thin films on large area substrates. 

The outcomes of NanoCleaR will benefit the many areas of active research involved in the manufacture of devices on large area plastic films. For example; flexible photovoltaics, lighting and display devices. These flexible devices are fabricated on polymer film by the repeated deposition, and patterning, of thin layer materials using roll-to-roll processes. 

The surface of the starting polymer film must be of very high quality in order to avoid creating defects in the device layers. Since these defects reduce manufacturing yield, in order to prevent them, a thin, flexible coating is generally applied to the polymer film prior to structuring. 

NanoCleaR is studying the ultra-thin aluminium oxide layers on the polymer film, which are designed as barrier layers for structured flexible photovoltaic modules. Barrier films are required to prevent the ingress of water vapour and oxygen from degrading the efficiency of solar energy conversion. Highly conformal aluminium oxide barrier layers have been produced by atomic layer deposition on plastic films with smooth surface coatings.

This paper begins by reporting the results of early stage measurements conducted to characterise the uncoated and coated polymer film surface topography using feature analysis. This paper will then describe how surface irregularities on the film can create defects within the nanometre-scale, aluminium oxide, barrier layer.

However, despite continuing efforts for the past decade, important questions about this process remain largely unexplained. Recently, nanotube research investigations have been conducted, aiming at revealing the underlying growth mechanisms, rather than merely studying the feasibility on new growth methods. Nonetheless, growth deactivation and the accompanying termination mechanisms still remain a topic of nanotube synthesis science. Due to the extremely small size, however, direct characterization of various transport and conversion events occurring at the catalyst surface is not an easy task. Thus investigations on growth kinetics are the first step to resolve questions about growth mechanism. Before exploring kinetic aspects of the growth process, one must achieve reliable growth conditions since growth non-reproducibility retards obtaining reliable growth data and undermines the scientific value of the data. In order to improve growth reliability, several factors that may contribute to growth non-reproducibility were identified and thereafter mitigated. Firstly, a simulation study was conducted to achieve insight into temperature and velocity profile of gases inside the reactor since gas flow dynamics can render growth environment near the substrate non-uniform. Interestingly, when argon gas was used as the main carrier gas, natural convective flow emerged, generating flow circulation before the gas reached the substrate placed at the center of the tube reactor. This flow circulation was not favorable for controlled gas introduction. This problem could be resolved by using a more heat- and momentum- conductive gas such as helium. Secondly, atomic force microscopy of annealed catalyst revealed that the aluminum sub-layer was not thermally stable at the growth temperature although this material has been widely used as a barrier layer to avoid silicide formation of catalyst on silicon substrates. In this respect, aluminum oxide should be a better choice, but under-stoichiometry of the aluminum oxide layer, which originated from sputter target degradation, affected thermal stability of the layer. Reactive sputtering by oxygen addition greatly enhanced thermal stability, and finally defect-free catalyst nanoparticles were formed by thermal annealing. Thirdly, the effect of the small part-per-million levels of oxygen-containing species on VACNT growth revealed that oxygen-containing gas impurities in nominally pure gas sources have a great influence on growth kinetics in a positive way; their presence increases catalyst lifetime and growth yield. However, the kinetic behavior that is highly sensitive to gas purity is prone to showing an interfering kinetic trend where the real mechanism is masked by the significant gas impurity effect. The stark difference in catalytic lifetime after the introduction of high-performance gas purifiers shows that extremely tight control of the reaction gas composition purity is necessary to obtain controlled growth of CNTs under atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions. Finally, more reliable growth of VACNTs was achieved, and thereafter the next step for fundamental growth kinetics measurement was followed. Finally, the CVD system was equipped with an optical micrometer that enables in-situ measurement of the height of growing VACNTs, which have advantageous structure facilitating measurement of growth kinetics since the array height has a robust correlation with growth yield and thereby growth rate. Various ethylene and hydrogen combinations were examined to capture growth kinetics related to different gas environment. The measured initial growth rates were linearly proportional to ethylene concentration, whereas a reciprocal relation was observed with respect to hydrogen concentration. The apparent activation energy was higher than reported in references. Flow rate variation experiments revealed that gas phase reaction is involved as the crucial growth step, which supports the observed high activation energy. Consequently, a growth model was proposed so that it could reasonably fit the initial growth rate data. Kinetic aspects related to growth deactivation were explored by measuring the final growth height and catalyst lifetime. Unlike growth with unpurified gases, growth became much less sensitive to gas composition after purification. Importantly, it was observed that growth deactivates by deficit of carbon source when relatively low ethylene was introduced. This result is surprising since ethylene pressure should be high enough at the catalyst, considering the calculated sticking coefficient of ethylene is very low, approximately 10^-5. Thus it substantiates the idea that catalyst-mediated gas pretreatment process is critical to sustain nanotube growth. Importantly, this idea challenges the widely accepted growth termination concept whereby nanotube stops growing due to catalyst encapsulation by excessive carbon. Indeed, reduced flow rate of gas mixture increased growth yield remarkably by promoting the gas pretreatment over the catalyst. Catalyst ripening, or steric hindrance by interaction of nanotubes can be an alternative reason for growth termination, but analysis of morphologies of the annealed catalyst and as-grown nanotubes revealed that their effects were not significant for the corresponding growth conditions.",,,,1,"['https://openalex.org/W1502573066', 'https://openalex.org/W1518291940', 'https://openalex.org/W1972373309', 'https://openalex.org/W2026272203', 'https://openalex.org/W2026589009', 'https://openalex.org/W2053590982', 'https://openalex.org/W2151644236', 'https://openalex.org/W643119304']",In,,False,

Given the complex topography of the modern integrated circuits where these diffusion barriers are to be used and the unique nature of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), those methods are considered to replace the traditional physical deposition approach, forming more conformal diffusion barriers layers. In this project, the growth of manganese-based films on silicon substrates via chemical deposition of two Mn metalorganic complexes, bis( N,N '-di-isopropyl-pentylamidinato) Mn(II)) ( Mn Amidinate) and methylcyclopentadienyl-manganese(I) tricarbonyl (MeCpMn(CO)3, was characterized and contrasted by using an instrument equipped with a reactor coupled to a X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analytical chamber. The goal of this project is to develop a molecular-level understanding of the surface chemistry for the precursor to improve the selection of manganese precursors.In our initial studies on the nature of films prepared by chemical means using MeCpMn(CO)3 as the precursor, it was found that a manganese silicate layer grows first and a thin manganese silicide film develops latter at the SiO2/Si (100) interface between approximately 550 and 750 K. It was also found that a typical nude ion gauge is capable of enhancing the deposition through gas-phase activation of MeCpMn(CO)3 by electron bombardment. Finally, Mn Amidinate was proved to be highly reactive, affording the deposition of Mn at reasonable rates, higher at higher temperatures, but also leading to the incorporation of nitrogen and additional carbon in the grown Mn(0) films; MeCpMn(CO)3, by contrast, was quite unreactive, but did not leave nitrogen contaminants on the surface. As with the carbonyl precursor, deposition with the Mn amidinate leads to the formation of a nonstoichiometric mixture of MnOx + SiOx and Mn silicate first, possibly followed by the formation of a thin subsurface Mn silicide layer. The combined Mn silicate/Mn silicide structure acts as an effective diffusion barrier, after which Mn(0) metallic films can be grown on top.One copper precursor, copper (I)-N,N'-di-sec-butylacetamidinate, was also deposited on the as-formed manganese thin film above with different ratios of Mn(0) and Mn silicate.

We introduce a general method to analyze the observed diﬀerence spectra using atomic multiplet calculations. Moreover, we ﬁnd experimental evidence for structural changes in PZT induced by the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization. PACS numbers: 77.80.-e, 78.70.Dm, 78.20.Bh Ferroelectric oxides exhibit a spontaneous, stable and switchable electric polarization that is due to atomic dis- placements of positive metallic ions and negative oxygen ions in opposite directions, which reduces the symme- try of the crystal lattice.[1] In thin ﬁlms—especially im- portant for applications such as non-volatile memories [2]—interface and surface eﬀects can dominate over the bulk like behavior of the ﬁlm interior [3]. For example strain induced by the lattice mismatch between substrate and ﬁlm lead to enhanced ferroelectric polarization and transition temperature in BaTiO 3 on (110) GdScO 3 and (110) DyScO 3 substrates [4]. Experiments and calcula- tions have shown that ferroelectric surfaces with oppo- site polarity have diﬀerent characteristics for adsorbing molecules and catalytic activity [5–7]. Conversely, the chemical environment can control the polarization of a ferroelectric ﬁlm by determining the ionic compensation at its surface [8]. To shed light on the impact of ferroelectric order on the electronic and atomic structure in the surface near region of ferroelectric PbZr 0.2 Ti 0.8 O 3 (PZT) ﬁlms deposited on SrRuO 3 (SRO) and La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSMO) electrodes, we employed soft x ray absorption (XA) spectroscopy. We show that the reduction in symmetry around the Ti 4+ ions has a pronounced impact on the Ti L 3,2 absorption edges which can be explained using atomic multiplet cal- culations. Moreover, we ﬁnd experimental evidence for changes in the PZT structure induced by the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization. (100)-oriented SrTiO 3 substrates were etched by buﬀered HF acid and annealed in ﬂowing oxygen at 1000 ◦ C for 3h. Bottom electrodes, 30nm pseudomor- phic layers of SRO and LSMO, were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at 700 ◦ C with oxygen pres- sure of 100mTorr and 200mTorr, respectively. 70 to 200-nm-thick PZT ﬁlms were deposited on the elec- trodes at 630 ◦ C in 100mTorr of oxygen. Piezo-force mi- croscopy (PFM) conﬁrmed that the ferroelectric polar- ization in the PZT/SRO points away from the bottom electrode while it points towards the bottom electrode in PZT/LSMO [9]. XA experiments were performed on beamline 4.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source by record- ing the sample drain current as a function of photon en- ergy [10]. Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) experiments were carried out on the SIM beamline at the Swiss Light Source [11]. All spectra were acquired at ambient temperature at pressures ≤ 5 · 10 −9 Torr with 100% linearly polarized x-rays impinging at an angle of 16 ◦ to the sample surface probing the topmost 5-8nm. Figure 1(a) shows XA spectra obtained from PZT/SRO. The Ti L 3,2 spectrum exhibits the charac- teristic structure of a Ti 4+ d 0 conﬁguration [12] due to electric-dipole transitions to 2p 5 3d 1 ﬁnal states. The 2p spin-orbit interaction splits the spectrum into 2p 3/2 (L 3 ) and 2p 1/2 (L 2 ) structures with energy separation of ∼5.5 eV, which are further split by crystal-ﬁeld interaction, i.e., the electrostatic potential, V , due to the neighboring lattice sites acting on the 3d orbitals. In octahedral (O) site symmetry the e orbitals of Ti point towards the oxy- gen ligands, while the t 2 orbitals point in between them, resulting in a lower energy for the latter. With increas- ing photon energy the four main peaks can therefore be labeled according to their main character as 2p 3/2 3d(t 2 ), 2p 3/2 3d(e), 2p 1/2 3d(t 2 ), and 2p 1/2 3d(e), c.f., Fig. 1. None of these states is pure due to mixing by 2p-3d electro- static interactions. Distortion of the Ti site from octa- hedral symmetry results in a non-symmetric broadening of especially the 3d(e) peaks [13]. Lowering to tetrago- nal symmetry splits the t 2 (O) states into b 2 = d(xy) and e = d(xz, yz) and the e(O) states into b 1 = d(x 2 −y 2 ) and a 1 = d(z 2 ). This gives a diﬀerence between XA spectra taken with polarization along the z- and x,y-directions, i.e., parallel and perpendicular to the surface normal. We observe a ±20% diﬀerence in the photon energy range of the 2p 3/2 3d(t 2 ) peak [c.f., Fig. 1(a)].

Gunn, K. Kálna, P. Ashburn, Harold M. H. Chong","Passivation, Electron Mobility, Critical dimension","ZnO nanowire transistors have shown a great potential in gas and chemical sensing, high power IC, short wavelength photodetector and light emitting applications. This is due to ZnO excellent semiconducting properties of high bulk mobility, large bandgap of 3.4eV and optical transparency from visible to mid-infra red spectrum. There are two approaches to realise ZnO nanowires; bottom-up and top-down. Bottom-up fabricated ZnO nanowire transistors exhibit a high mobility > 1000 cm 2 /V.s and large output drain current but device electrical performance is difficult to reproduce due to size variation and material quality. Therefore, a top-down fabrication approach is an attractive option since nanowire properties and size can be controlled by process parameters. In this work, we propose a top-down fabrication approach to produce nanowires using a combined photolithography, atomic layer deposition and anisotropic plasma etching technology. ZnO nanowires were fabricated on 150mm diameter SiO 2 -Si wafer with a dimension of 40nm x 38nm. The nanowires are made into field-effect transistors with a channel length from 1.3um to 18.6µm to study channel scaling. Preliminary electrical measurements give field-effect mobility of 0.5 cm 2 /V.s to 3 cm 2 /V.s and I on /I off of 2×10 6 . We anticipate mobility improvement by 3 times through passivation of the nanowire surface thanks to reduction of donor and surface traps with potential for logic circuits in display applications.",,,,0,[],Sultan,,False,

These gases react with the substrate one at a time repeatedly until the growing atomic layer is sufficiently deposited onto the wafer. Levitech is a Netherlands-based company that supplies solar cell manufacturing equipment (Levitrack) employing ALD technique to the industry . In levitrack, the wafers are injected with a high-pressure valve into a chamber where ALD process takes place. The wafers oscillate regularly in lateral directions under the influence of the gases during the transportation. Sometimes the wafers are damaged due to the collision between the wafer and the side-walls when the oscillation amplitude is beyond the range of the chamber. The cause for the oscillation as well as the methods to reduce oscillation amplitude is to be studied in order to reduce the failure of the wafers. This assignment is focused on the research and improvement of dynamic behavior of the wafer in lateral directions. In this project, a fundamental hypothesis is firstly proposed that the wafer oscillates with a deterministic stiffness coefficient. The oscillation is caused by the component of the injecting velocity in lateral directions. A theoretical dynamic equation of the wafer is then derived, which is closed with the value of stiffness coefficient computed in numerical approach. Afterwards, the dynamic equation is verified with experimental work. In numerical simulation, a parameter study is executed to reduce the oscillation amplitude. A discussion about the influence of different parameters on the amplitude is performed as well. Finally, an analytical explanation to the physics is elaborated in this report. In this project, many reasonable assumptions are figured out to simplify the problems as well as to highlight the dominant properties of the physics. Laminar flow and thin-film flow are coupled in numerical computation in order to increase computation efficiency. It is finally found that the unavoidable leaking of the device plays a more important role in causing the collision than the lateral component of injecting velocity of the wafer. In addition, the fundamental hypothesis, dynamic equations and numerical computation are demonstrated sufficient in industry by experimental work.

The project seeks to develop integrated process inspection, cleaning, repair and control systems for nano-scale thin films on large area substrates. As the PV – photovoltaic industry turns its attention on increasing efficiency and functional lifespan, the need for improved, high resolution and high speed surface inspection for the quality control of the manufacture of large area of flexible PV modules is essential. 


Inspection and metrology are the basic elements to guarantee maximum quality, longer lifetime and enhanced power yield. Flexible PV films are the newest development in the renewable energy field and the latest films have efficiencies at or beyond the level of Si-based rigid PV modules. These modules are fabricated on polymer film by the repeated deposition, and patterning, of thin layer materials using roll-to-roll technology. These modules at present are however highly susceptible to long term environmental degradation as a result of water vapor transmission through the barrier layers defects to the active layer. To reduce the WVTR the PV modules are coated with a barrier layer of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) on a planarised polymer substrate. This highly conformal layer is produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. Nevertheless water vapour transmission is still facilitated by the presence of micro and nano-scale defects in these barriers which results in decreased cell efficiency and degrades longevity. Therefore, in this study surface metrology techniques including: White Light Scanning Interferometry (WLSI), optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), were used to characterise the water vapor barrier defects. Areal surface texture parameter analysis allows the efficient separation of small insignificant features from significant defects. This parametric analysis is then correlated with the water vapour transmission rate as measured on typical sets of films using Isostatic standard test (MOCON). The outcomes would appear to suggest that small numbers of large defects are the dominant factor in determining WVTR. This result provides the basis for developing roll-to-roll in process metrology devices for quality control.

In the first two parts, the researches mainly focus on the properties of ITO nanowires. The applications of ITO/(ZnO-HfO2) core-shell nanowires are discussed in the third and fourth parts. For the properties of ITO nanowires, different sizes of Au nanoparticles were used to synthesize the nanowires with well controlled diameters. It is found that the resistivity is influenced by different diameters of ITO NWs controlled by different sizes of Au NPs. Competition of conductive factors such as Sn ions and oxygen vacancy confirmed by the X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS) analyses were investigated and discussed at different diameters of ITO NWs. In the secondary part of the thesis, the screen effect of ITO NWs was discussed. By selective area growth of ITO nanowires patterned by grid, the length and the density of ITO NWs can be controlled, diminishing the screen effect so as to enhance field emission properties, namely less the threshold filed. In the third part of thesis, the ITO/ZnO and ITO/HfO2/ZnO core-shell nanowires were synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD), which are found to enhance the field-emission property. The distribution of nanocrystals and oxygen deficient states were investigated and characterized by TEM and X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS). In the final part of the thesis, ITO/HfO2 core-shell nanowires were applied for resistive change memory (RRAM). Interesting, the electrical performance of ITO/HfO2 core-shell nanowire shows can be improved, compared with thin film device.

These materials were then characterised in terms of rat osteoblast adhesion, morphology and differentiation. UHMWPE discs produced from a machined cylinder or impact moulded discs were coated with titanium oxide by ALD. Light, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy with EDX were used to characterise the coated surfaces. These approaches showed 1-1.5 micron tooling grooves with a periodicity of 40 microns on the machined discs whilst the moulded discs exhibited nanotopographical features. The titanium oxide coating was successfully deposited on discs from both sources but was not uniform across the surfaces, with vein-like ‘creases’ clearly visible. We believe that these features are due to the thermal expansion of the UHMWPE discs during the ALD process and their subsequent cooling. Coated and uncoated discs were seeded with osteoblasts for 24 hours, then fixed. Immunofluorescence microscopy and computer-based image processing enabled determination of osteoblast numbers, size and shape. A trend of larger average cell area was associated with the coated discs and P Osteoblasts were also cultured on the discs in osteogenic medium to promote bone nodule formation. After a few weeks, von Kossa staining and computer-based image processing allowed calculation of surface area covered with bone nodules for each of the discs. Based on results from three of each type of disc, a significantly greater proportion of the surface area of coated discs was covered with calcified deposits compared to uncoated discs (P The hypothesis for our study was that TiO2 coating of a polymer might better promote osteoblast interaction with the biomaterial surface leading to enhanced osteogenesis.

Powering Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) such as autonomous smart-dust nodes using conventional Li-ion batteries is not possible. It is not only new batteries based on new materials but there is also a need of modifying the actual battery design. In this context, the conception of 3D nano-architectured Li-ion batteries is explored. There are several micro-battery concepts that are studied; however in this thesis, the focus is concentrated on one particular architecture that can be described as the successive deposition of battery components (active material, electrolyte, active material) on free-standing arrays of nano-sized columns of a current collector. After a brief introduction about Li-ion batteries and 3D micro-batteries, the electrodeposition of Al through an alumina template using an ionic liquid electrolyte to form free-standing columns of Al current collector is described. The crucial deposition parameters influencing the nucleation and growth of the Al nano-rods are discussed. The deposition of active electrode material on the nano-structured current collector columns is described for 2 distinct active materials deposited using different techniques. Deposition of TiO2 using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) as active material on top of the nano-structured Al is also presented. The obtained deposits present high uniformity and high covering of the specific surface of the current collector. When cycled versus lithium and compared to planar electrodes, an increase of the capacity was proven to be directly proportional to the specific area gained from shifting from a 2D to a 3D construction. Cu2Sb 3D electrodes were prepared by the electrodeposition of Sb onto a nano-structured Cu current collector followed by an annealing step forcing the alloying between the current collector and Sb. The volume expansion observed during Sb alloying with Li is buffered by the Cu matrix and thus the electrode stability is greatly enhanced (from only 20 cycles to more than 120 cycles). Finally, the deposition of a hybrid polymer electrolyte onto the developed 3D electrodes is presented. Even though the deposition is not conformal and that issues of capacity fading need to be addressed, preliminary results attest that it is possible to cycle the obtained 3D electrode-electrolyte versus lithium without the appearance of short-circuits.",,,,0,[],Perre,,False,

In our previous work we presented ALD growth of VO2 by using Tetrakis[EthylMethylAmino]Vanadium and ozone at a temperature of 150°C [1]. XPS revealed the 4+ oxidation state of vanadium, indicating growth of VO2. Post-ALD thermal processing proved essential to crystallize the VO2 in the desired tetragonal phase (R). In this work we present the influence of the oxygen partial pressure on phase formation during such thermal processes. Additionally the influence of film thickness and annealing temperature on the post-annealing properties were studied, including morphology and SMT characteristics.
During thermal processing a minimum oxygen partial pressure of approximately 1 Pa is indispensable to form crystalline VO2 (R) (figure 1). Oxygen partial pressures above 2 Pa show an intermediate monoclinic phase (B), which transforms to VO2 (R) at higher temperatures. At a value of 35 Pa this VO2 (B) phase finally transforms to V6O13 instead of VO2 (R). For very thin films, the thermal post-processing may result in agglomeration of the VO2 layers on the SiO2 substrate. Samples with a film thickness above 20nm show a typical resistivity ratio during the SMT of more than 2 orders of magnitude when annealed in the range 450°C to 500°C. For thinner films or higher annealing temperatures the resistivity ratio is suppressed and an overall increased resistivity is observed due to agglomeration (figure 2).",,,,0,[],Rampelberg,,False,

Several novel devices are demonstrated to improve the performance of the novel nanocrystal memories.A novel TiSi2 nanocrystal memory was demonstrated. TiSi2 nanocrystals were synthesized on SiO2 by annealing Ti covered Si nanocrystals. Compared to the reference Si nanocrystal memory, both experiment and simulation results show that TiSi2 nanocrystal memory exhibits larger memory window, faster writing and erasing, and longer retention lifetime as a result of the metallic property of the silicide nanocrystals. Due to thermally stable, CMOS compatible properties, TiSi2 nanocrystals are highly promising for nonvolatile memory device application. Metal/high-k dielectric core-shell nanocrystal memory capacitors were proposed. This kind of MOS memory shows good performance in charge storage capacity, programming and erasing speed. A self-assembled di-block co-polymer is used to align the NCs to improve the scalability of the overall sample. An ordered Co/Al2O3 core-shell nanocrystal (NC) nonvolatile memory device was also fabricated. Self-assembled di-block co-polymer process aligned the NCs with uniform size. Co/Al2O3 core-shell NCs were formed using atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 before and after the ordered Co NC formation. Compared to Co NC memory, Co/Al2O3 core-shell NC memory shows improved retention performance without sacrificing writing and erasing speeds.Another new discrete NiSi nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized by rapid thermal oxygen annealing (RTO) of very thin Si/Ni/Si films on SiO2 tunneling layer. The RTO process resulted in smooth surface of the NC floating layer, in turn, uniform thickness of subsequent control oxide layer. Metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor memory was fabricated. Electrical properties of the memory device such as programming, erasing and retention were characterized and good performance was achieved, which is due to the reduction of the leakage paths in the smooth device structure. Therefore, it is concluded that metallic nanocrystal with aligned core-shell structure memory is a very promising candidate to replace Si nanocrystal for future generation nonvolatile flash memory devices.",,,,0,[],Zhou,,False,

Lelu, Pawel Sikorski","Nanoporous, Copper oxide, Template","As the length scale of basic biological processes coincides more and more with the length scale at which artificial nanostructures can be constructed, the interplay between those structures and biological systems becomes an increasingly promising field of research. This thesis is centred around high aspect ratio inorganic nanostructures, such as nanotubes and nanowires and how they can be made using biological structures, as well as how they can be used to manipulate biological systems. Two different approaches were taken: First, the very regular nanoporous structure, which makes up the spines of the bristle worm Aphrodita Aculeata (sea mouse) was used as a template to produce nanowires and nanotubes with a diameter of about 200 nm and a length of a few hundred microns. Nanowires made of nickel and copper were produced by electrodeposition and nanotubes made of aluminium oxide were produced by atomic layer deposition. Additionally, it was shown that the sea mouse spine based template was rigid enough to withstand a wide range of pHand temperatures, which should make it possible to grow nanostructures of a variety of materials by adopting fabrication procedures developed for membrane based nanoporous templates. In a second approach, vertically aligned arrays of copper oxide nanowires were grown in a catalyst-free thermal oxidation process on copper substrates. Methods of patterning were developed for the substrates and their nanowire decoration as well as a method for growing wires in large homogeneous arrays on inexpensive copper foils. Patterned copper substrates with and without a coating of nanowires were then used as the basis for a superhydrophobic droplet microfluidic system. Finally, the homogeneous arrays of vertically aligned copper oxide nanowires were integrated into photoresist microstructures made by traditional UV lithography to construct a transparent, cell friendly, compartmentalised system, which is intended to serve as a platform to transfect cells by impalement.",,,,0,[],Mumm,,False,

This effect could be strongly orientation-dependent in manganites due to the strong spin-orbit interaction. We have successfully fabricated high-quality (110)-oriented [La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (t) /SrTiO3 (3ML)]n superlattices and systematically studied their crystal structure as well as interface magnetism. Compared to the (100)-oriented counterparts, LSMO has a thinner dead-layer and a higher interface moment at the (110)-orientated LSMO/STO interface. The magnetism of the manganite interface could be manipulated by taking advantage of the orientation-dependent nature of the exchange interactions.To engineer the interface between the tunnel barrier and LSMO, we have developed a high quality Al2O3 (HfO2) tunnel barrier in LSMO/A2O3/Co stacking structure with A2O3 (HfO2) grown ex-situ by the Atomic Layer Deposition as well as LSMO/STO/Co with LSMO and STO epitaxially grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition in both (100) and (110) orientations. Our specially designed shadow mask technique ensures a high yield and high performance of magnetic tunnel junction devices. The magneto-transport measurements show very interesting results.The thermoelectric properties of graphene have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. The exotic band structure of graphene leads to unusual thermoelectric properties which are sensitive to the carrier mobility. However, all the previous experiments were based on graphene samples with fixed mobility and make comparisons between different samples. Recently, we showed that it is possible to tune the carrier mobility of the same graphene device over a wide range. We adopted this method and systematically studied the magneto- Seebeck and Nernst effects for different mobility values. The crossover behavior of the Seebeck signal reported before around Charge Neutral Point is related to the splitting of zeroth Landau Level. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Nernst peak linearly depends on the carrier mobility in graphene.Besides, we find that the empirical relation between the longitudinal and Hall resistivities and its counterpart between the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients hold surprisingly well for graphene in the quantum transport regime except near the Dirac point. The validity of the relations is cross-examined by independently varying the magnetic field and the carrier density in graphene.

This work is divided into two parts: the first involves the synthesis of inorganic semiconductor-based nanostructured materials; the second focuses on developing porous metal oxide-based pseudocapacitors.

At 300 K, the surfaces reconstruct to form the group III rich [beta]3'(4 x 2) reconstructions and at 80 K, the surfaces reconstruct to form the [beta]3'(4 x 4) reconstruction. A novel hybridization scheme is required for these reconstructions. Oxidation of the InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) surface by O₂ was studied and it was determined that this occurs via an autocatalytic process, displacing surface As. Oxidation is initiated on the group III rows of the surface, but the autocatalysis is in competition with a thermodynamic stability that limits the size of oxidation sites in the low coverage regime. Two methods for the formation of an interface between the high-κ dielectric, HfO₂ on InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) and In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) were examined: reactive oxidation of Hf metal by O₂ and electron beam deposition of HfO₂. Reactive oxidation of Hf metal is problematic, but e⁻ beam deposition of HfO₂ showed that the p-type pinning behavior of In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) can be at least partially removed. Several oxygen atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursors were studied for the reaction (ALD initiation step) of high-[kappa] oxide growth on the InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) surface : water, hydrogen peroxide, and isopropyl alcohol. All of these O precursors showed displacement reactions occurring on the III-V surfaces, but proceeded to varying degrees and by different pathways. Water displaces As, but does not fully oxidize it, HOOH etches the semiconductor surface at all temperatures, and isopropyl alcohol shows chemisorption site selectivity at 100 ⁰C. The reaction of the ALD precursor, trimethyl aluminum (TMA) on InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) and In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) was studied. An ordered, self-terminating single monolayer reaction occurs in the high coverage regime on both semiconductor surfaces. The p -type pinning behavior observed on the clean In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) surface is removed upon formation of the TMA-induced reaction; the surface was passivated for Al₂O₃ growth via metal-first ALD initiation.

The small mode volumes and long photon lifetimes associated with PhC cavities are desirable for sensing applications, which utilize the sensitivity of the light-matter interaction (LMI) inside the cavity region. In pursuit of enhancing the LMI of PhC cavity-based sensors, this dissertation focuses on the design, simulation, fabrication, and testing of Multiple-Hole Defect (MHD) PhC cavities. MHD PhCs are 2D silicon slab PhCs with small, sub-wavelength sized âdefect holesâ placed directly into point defect PhC cavities. The insertion of MHDs increases the spatial overlap in the PhC cavity between the modal field and any surface perturbations, such as captured molecules, made within the cavity. Several designs of MHD PhC cavities were explored using Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations in order to understand the effect of MHD integration on the PhC cavity resonance frequency and quality factor. It was found that the LMI is maximized when defect holes are placed in regions of highest field localization within PhC cavities. The sensitivity of MHD PhCs to bulk refractive index changes was investigated by wetting the structures with different fluids. The bulk index sensitivity of MHD PhC cavities with 80 nm diameter defect holes was found to be 98 nm/RIU, which is larger than comparable PhC cavity sensors without defect holes. The sensitivity of MHD PhCs to small refractive perturbations on the sensor surfaces was explored by binding small-molecules to the surfaces of MHD PhCs treated with either a native oxide or an atomic layer deposition (ALD) silicon dioxide. It was found that the sensitivity of PhC sensors to a 0.8 nm thick, surface-bound aminosilane monolayer was increased by 160% when three 60 nm diameter defect holes were added to an L3 PhC cavity.

The utilization of this compound in thermal CVD experiments yielded not only the most stable and widely used α-Fe2O3 phase, but also the rare and scarcely investigated β- and e-Fe2O3 polymorphs, that could be selectively obtained as pure phases with controlled nano-organization. In addition, Fe(hfa)2TMEDA was used in PECVD experiments as molecular source for both Fe and F thanks to the unique reactivity of non-equilibrium cold plasmas, resulting in the obtainment of F-doped _- and _-Fe2O3 nanosystems. Following the e_orts devoted to the preparation of single-phase nanomaterials with improved functional performances, the fabrication of metal/oxide (M/Fe2O3, with M = Pt, Ag, Au) and oxide/oxide (CuO/Fe2O3, Fe3-xTixO4/Fe2O3) nanocomposites has finally been accomplished through the combination of CVD with sputtering or ALD. The study of the interplay between processing conditions, system features and functional activities was proved to be a successful tool of the whole PhD research activity. To this regard, a thorough characterization of the material composition, morphology and spatial organization, micro- and nano-structure and optical properties, was carried out by the use of forefront and complementary analytical techniques. In addition, the functional performances of selected nanosystems were investigated in view of their possible use in a variety of technological end-uses [magnetism, Li-ion batteries, gas sensing of ammable/toxic analytes, and photo-activated applications (photo-induced hydrophilicity, photocatalytic pollutant decomposition, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical H2 production)]. The results obtained in this PhD work demonstrate that the preparation of iron(III) oxide systems, either as such or in combination with others guest phases, with selected phase composition (α- or β- or e-Fe2O3) and nano-organization, represents a valuable answer to meet open challenges in various high-tech applications. In particular, the adopted approaches involving vapour phase-related routes offer the possibility of future up-scaling and commercialization of the studied materials, one of the key issues for their technological exploitation in advanced devices.",,,,0,[],Carraro,,False,

Cavanagh, Yawen Yan, Steven M. George, Seung-Min Lee",Cycling,"Significant advances in energy density, rate capability and safety will be required for the implementation of Li-ion batteries in next generation electric vehicles. We have demonstrated atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a promising method to enable superior cycling performance for a vast variety of battery electrodes. The electrodes range from already demonstrated commercial technologies (cycled under extreme conditions) to new materials that could eventually lead to batteries with higher energy densities. For example, an Al2O3 ALD coating with a thickness of ~ 8 A was able to stabilize the cycling of unexplored MoO3 nanoparticle anodes with a high volume expansion. The ALD coating enabled stable cycling at C/2 with a capacity of ~ 900 mAh/g. Furthermore, rate capability studies showed the ALD-coated electrode maintained a capacity of 600 mAh/g at 5C. For uncoated electrodes it was only possible to observe stable cycling at C/10. Also, we recently reported that a thin ALD Al2O3 coating with a thickness of ~5 A can enable natural graphite (NG) electrodes to exhibit remarkably durable cycling at 50 degrees C. The ALD-coated NG electrodes displayed a 98% capacity retention after 200 charge-discharge cycles. In contrast, bare NG showed a rapid decay. Additionally, Al2O3 ALD filmsmore » with a thickness of 2 to 4 A have been shown to allow LiCoO2 to exhibit 89% capacity retention after 120 charge-discharge cycles performed up to 4.5 V vs Li/Li+. Bare LiCoO2 rapidly deteriorated in the first few cycles. The capacity fade is likely caused by oxidative decomposition of the electrolyte at higher potentials or perhaps cobalt dissolution. Interestingly, we have recently fabricated full cells of NG and LiCoO2 where we coated both electrodes, one or the other electrode as well as neither electrode. In creating these full cells, we observed some surprising results that lead us to obtain a greater understanding of the ALD coatings. We have also recently coated a binder free LiNi0.04Mn0.04Co02O2 electrode containing 5 wt% single-walled carbon nanotubes as the conductive additive and demonstrated both high rate capability as well as the ability to cycle the cathode to 5 V vrs.

In this work, the performance of silicon etching processes is evaluated, and utilized in creating devices for high precision sensing of mechanical forces. Emerging methods such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and focused ion beam (FIB) processing are combined with established technologies in order to achieve extended functionalities.
 The thesis is focused on the fabrication of components from single crystal silicon. In the developed processes, anisotropic tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) wet etching has a central role. The material behavior related to substrate specifications, doping level, and the effects inherent to thin films, is studied both during the fabrication stage and in the final structures. Furthermore, the intrinsic residual stress generation in mechanical devices is investigated.
 The results were applied in successful production of mechanical sensors with superior accuracy in acoustic wave detection. The specific features of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology were utilized in the fabrication of released, membrane-type cantilevers that serve as highly sensitive microphones in photoacoustic spectroscopy. Moreover, ALD thin film coatings were shown to be advantageous in manipulating the functional properties of resonant silicon sensors. A step towards further device miniaturization was taken by using FIB implantation as a wet etching mask to realize 3D nanoscale structures.
 Some of the developed cantilever sensors have already been implemented in commercial photoacoustic gas analyzers. In a broader perspective, the achievements related to stress control in mechanical silicon structures are of great importance in reliable production of various micro- and nanomechanical systems. All the methods employed in this work are compatible with integrated circuit (IC) processing, which enables combining the developed processes with electronic chips and the adaptation to industrial manufacturing.; Korkealaatuisten materiaaliominaisuuksiensa vuoksi piilla on viimeisten vuosikymmenten ajan ollut keskeinen asema mikromekaniikan kehityksen karjessa.

On OLEDs, we demonstrated that with a 10-A ALD Al2O3 film overcoated on a poly[1-methoxy-4-(2’-ethyl-hexyloxy)-2,5-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) electro- luminescent layer, the OLEDs not only withstood an aggressive photolithographic patterning process without any degradation but unprecedentedly showed increased luminous efficiency. Although the ALD precursor, trimethylaluminum (TMA), was found to damage MEH-PPV through addition to MEH-PPV’s vinylene groups, its damaging effect was eliminated by pre-treating the MEH-PPV surface with isopropyl alcohol (IPA), whose hydroxyl groups scavenged TMA throughout the ALD process.
On the encapsulation of OSCs, we developed ALD processes that both prevented degradations caused by ambient gases and served as an annealing step that increased the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells. With the ALD temperature set at 140 oC and the deposition time set at 1 hr, OSCs based on blended poly-3- hexylthiophene (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid-methylester (PCBM), were optimally annealed during encapsulation, achieving a PCE of 3.66%. Encapsulating the cells with a 26-nm Al2O3/HfO2 nanolaminated film overcoated with an epoxy-resin protection layer enabled the cell to obtain an in-air degradation rate that was similar to cell stored in O2/H2O-free atmosphere. The Al2O3/HfO2 nanolaminated structure resolved the problem of hydrolysis-induced aging that occurred in single Al2O3 films, owing to the hydrophobicity of the HfO2 layers. Additionally, extended exposure of the ALD precursors during the ALD process ensured complete coverage of ALD films over the P3HT:PCBM layer at the perimeter of the cells.
On flexible air-stable OSCs, we developed low-temperature (90 oC) ALD ZnO films as both gas barriers and electron-collection layers for P3HT:PCBM-based inverted OSCs. By utilizing a long purge time (25-s) and a low deposition temperature (90 oC) in the ALD process, we obtained high electron mobility (9.6 cm2/V s) and low carrier concentration (2.1×1017 cm-3) in the ZnO films, thereby optimizing their electron- collecting function and achieving 4.06% PCE in the resultant inverted OSCs. Moreover, when deposited on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates, the ALD ZnO films at 70 nm of thickness showed excellent barrier properties: water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) < 10-3 g/m2 day and helium transmission rate (HeTR) of 5.03 cc/m2 day. This moisture-blocking capability was crucial for achieving air-stable inverted OSCs, as we determined that air-induced degradations of inverted OSCs mainly originated from moisture uptake by the poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer. Using an 70 nm ALD ZnO film for the electron-collection/barrier dual functions as well as a 26-nm Al2O3/HfO2 nanolaminate as the encapsulation layer, we demonstrated flexible OSCs on PET substrates with initial PCE of 2.77% and with negligible air-induced degradation: the OSCs showed near identical degradation rate as the control devices stored in an O2/H2O-free environment, and they retained 73% of their initial PCE over 1800 hr of storage under a 65 oC/60% RH accelerated aging condition.

Al2O3 and AlN films were deposited on two substrates, silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) based heterostructures, AlGaN/GaN, to compare their electrical performances as alternative dielectrics for wide bandgap semiconductor based power devices. Amorphous Al2O3 was deposited at 195-200 o C at a rate of 0.75-1 i?½/cycle. The film exhibited a dielectric constant of 9 and a leakage current of 10 -3 A/cm 2 at 8 MV/cm on SiC. When it was applied on AlGaN/GaN, the Al2O3 passivation resulted in an increased sheet carrier density but a dramatic decrease in the mobility compared to those of a clean AlGaN/GaN substrate. Crystalline AlN was deposited at 540 o C with a rate of 1.5 i?½/cycle. The AlN film demonstrated a dielectric constant of 8.3 and a leakage current density of 10 -3 A/cm 2 at 4.3 MV/cm on SiC. When AlN was applied on AlGaN/GaN, an increased carrier density was observed while the mobility was at 1130 cm 2 /V-s, similar to that of a clean AlGaN/GaN. The electrical properties of synthesized AlN were promising and comparable to those of MBE or sputtering synthesized AlN, confirming the promise of ALD for synthesizing AlN. Due to their material properties, Al2O3 is preferred choice for preventing gate leakage current on SiC, whereas AlN demonstrated superior capability of passivating AlGaN/GaN. Stoichiometric LiAlSiO4 was realized at 290 o C with a rate of ~23 i?½/global cycle, in which one global cycle sequence represented 10(Al-O)-6(Li-O)-4(Si-O) ALD cycles. As-deposited films were amorphous, pin-hole free, as confirmed by electrochemical testing in ferrocene, and conformal over 3D nanowires. The ionic conductivity of LixAlySizO films was 10 -9 -10 -7 S/cm and the activation energy was 0.34-0.98 eV, both correlated to cation contents in the films. After rapid thermal annealing at 900 o C, the as-deposited LiAlSiO4 films crystallized into epitaxial b-LiAlSiO4 on Si (001) with a relationship of b-LiAlSiO4 (1 2bar 1 0) || Si (100) and b-LiAlSiO4 (1 0 1bar 0) || Si (001). The application of the LiAlSiO4 film on tin dioxide (SnO2) NWs showed that the film possessed a high ionic conductivity, which suppressed the formation of metallic Sn particles, showing the capability of LixAlySizO films to serve as electrolytes and surface modification layers in 3D Li-ion microbatteries.",,,,0,[],Perng,,False,

Copper oxides--both cuprous oxide, Cu2O, and cupric oxide, CuO--are abundant, environmentally friendly, and highly versatile. An attractive feature unique to both copper oxides is the ease of synthesis through a one-step thermal oxidation of copper foil in ambient environment, yielding various oxide compositions and morphologies according to the oxidation temperature and time. There are many possible applications for the copper oxide materials, including pigments in ceramics, catalysts, sensors, solar cells, and batteries, to name a few. This work presents applications in electrochemical cells, more specifically photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, and gas sensors.The synthesis processes of copper oxides are characterized in terms of processing parameters and inspected with X-ray diffraction measurements and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three kinds of copper oxides were investigated for photocatalytic testing: 1 micrometer-thick, and 5 micrometer-thick Cu2O films via 0.5 hr and 10 hr oxidation at 300 °C, respectively, and a 10 micrometer-thick Cu2O film with 8 micrometer tall vertically-aligned CuO nanowire array on top via a 2 hr oxidation at 500 °C. Under AM 1.5 illumination, photocurrents of 0.8, 1.3, and 1.7 mA/cm2, respectively, were recorded for these samples, exceeding the performance of previously reported as-synthesized, co-catalyst-free copper oxide photocathodes. Possible explanations for the observed performance based on increased minority carrier diffusion length and enhanced surface electric field are discussed. Future prospects of highly photoactive and stable copper oxide-based photocathodes are also explored. The effectiveness of surface passivation for the copper oxide photocathodes using pristine and hydrogenated TiO2 thin films are quantified through prolonged photoelectrochemical testing. Photocathodes protected with TiO2 films of 50 nm thickness deposited by atomic layer deposition exhibited excellent stability, but the photocurrent dropped to ~0.06 mA/cm2. The results of CO2 reduction using electrochemically reduced Cu sites from copper oxide electrodes as precursors for CO2 reduction is also demonstrated. The proportion of reaction products H2, CO, HCOOH, and CH3COOH is shown to be tunable according to the surface morphology and composition of the original oxide electrode. Therefore, these electrodes exhibit the potential for highly selective liquid fuel production, including a measured H2/CO product ratio of ~2.6 for maximized production of liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process.A simple gas sensing architecture taking advantage of the vertically-aligned growth of CuO nanowires is demonstrated.

One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanowires can provide several advantages for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting due to their high surface areas and excellent charge transport and collection efficiency. This dissertation discusses various nanowire photoelectrodes for single or dual semiconductor systems, and their linked PEC cells for self-driven water splitting. After an introduction of solar water splitting in the first chapter, the second chapter demonstrates water oxidative activities of hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanowire arrays depending on their length and surface properties. The photocurrents with TiO2 nanowire arrays approach saturation due to their poor charge collection efficiency with longer nanowires despite increased photon absorption efficiency. Epitaxial grains of rutile atomic layer deposition (ALD) shell on TiO2 nanowire increase the photocurrent density by 1.5 times due to improved charge collection efficiency especially in the short wavelength region. Chapter three compares the photocurrent density of the planar Si and Si nanowire arrays coated by anatase ALD TiO2 thin film as a model system of a dual bandgap system. The electroless etched Si nanowire coated by ALD TiO2 (Si EENW/TiO2) shows 2.5 times higher photocurrent density due to lower reflectance and higher surface area. Also, this chapter illustrates that n-Si/n-TiO2 heterojunction is a promising structure for the photoanode application of a dual semiconductor system, since it can enhance the photocurrent density compared to p-Si/n-TiO2 junction with the assistance of bend banding at the interface. Chapter four demonstrates the charge separation and transport of photogenerated electrons and holes within a single asymmetric Si/TiO2 nanowire. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements show the higher surface potential on the n-TiO2 (photoanode) side relative to the p-Si (photocathode) side under UV illumination as the result of hole accumulation on the TiO2 side and electron accumulation on the Si side which are desirable charge separation for solar water splitting. In chapter five, TiO2 is replaced with single phase InGaN nanowire in a dual bandgap photoanode to show the potential for solar water splitting with high surface area Si/InGaN hierarchical nanowire arrays and InGaN as a possible candidate for visible light absorber. An enhancement of 5 times in photocurrent was observed when the surface area increased from InGaN nanowires on planar Si to InGaN nanowires on Si wires. Chapter six demonstrates a self-driven water splitting device with the p/n PEC cell which consists of a photocathode and a photoanode. The operating photocurrent (Iop) with the p/n PEC cell is enhanced when n-Si/p-Si photovoltage cell was embedded under an n-TiO2 photoanode by utilizing the photovoltage generated by a Si PV cell. Also, the Si nanowire photocathode surface is modified with Pt and TiO2 to increase hydrogen reducing activity and stability which enhances Iop of the p/n PEC cell as well. When Si/TiO2 nanowire photocathode is linked with n-Si/p-Si photovoltage cell embedded TiO2 nanowire photoanode, the p/n PEC cell shows water splitting without bias voltage confirmed with 2:1 ratio of hydrogen:oxygen gas evolution and a 92 % Faradic efficiency.

In plants, chloroplasts store the sun's energy using a system of integrated photosynthetic nanostructures including light-absorbing pigments, electron-transport chains, and chemical catalysts. However, neither such integration of nanostructures nor energy conversion efficiency suitable for practical applications has been achieved in artificial photosynthesis. In this context, the subject of my graduate research is to develop an integrated system using nanowire-based nanostructures to imitate natural photosynthesis. This centers on two themes: (1) constructing novel integrated nanostructures for solar-to-fuel conversion, and (2) developing next-generation materials and catalysts for improved photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance.Although natural photosynthesis organizes its active components at the nanometer scale to better control the process of energy conversion, this level of integration had not been realized until recently for artificial photosynthesis. Here the construction of a nanowire-based integrated system to realize such a nanoscopic control is demonstrated. Since all of the processes in PEC relate to the interfaces among semiconductor light-absorbers, electrocatalysts, and the electrolyte, the first to realize an integrated nanosystem was to under how photo-excited carriers would transfer within these interfaces. By using kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), the local electrostatic potential of an asymmetric nanowire composed of Si and a TiO2 shell, which was covered in a layer of water. Different local potentials were observed in dark and under illumination, which provides the knowledge that the heterojunction of Si and TiO2 could function as a Z-scheme system for solar water splitting.After obtaining this piece of information, we moved forward to develop an integrated nanosystem for artificial photosynthesis. Taking the concept of Z-scheme, we used Si and TiO2 nanowires as building blocks to construct a tree-shaped heterostructure. In this structure, the positions of the reduction and oxidation components were pre-defined to mimic the spatial control found in chloroplasts. The integrated standalone device splits H2O into H2 and O2 under simulated sunlight, with an efficiency of solar-to-fuel conversion comparable to that of natural photosynthesis. This first demonstration paves the way for using nano-sized building blocks to achieve efficient solar-to-fuel conversion. The nanowire-based integration allows individual building blocks to be replaced with newly developed ones. In this dissertation advanced building blocks for artificial photosynthesis is also demonstrated.We have explored new materials and methods to improve the energy conversion efficiency of semiconductor light-absorbers. Solution-phase synthesis of III-V semiconductor nanowires was successfully demonstrated for photocatalytic reactions, and the nanowires' electronic properties could be fine-tuned to fit the needs of device integration. Also we demonstrated enhancement of the photoanodic activity of hematite (Fe2O3) using the surface plasmon resonance of exquisitely controlled Au nanostructures. Additionally, new electrocatalysts suitable for practical applications are developed. We first looked into the lower limit of platinum (Pt) loading as a catalyst for the H2 evolution reaction (HER). Using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, it is possible to quantitatively controlled the Pt loading down to about 0.2% of a monolayer (~10 ng/cm2), which is sufficient for some PEC applications. Cobalt sulfide, an earth-abundant catalyst, was also synthesized by electrodeposition. It acted as a HER catalyst in water at neutral pH and could be coupled with a Si photocathode for solar H2 production. Moreover we are developing an effective CO2 reduction catalyst of near unity selectivity for acetate production, which could be added into the integrated nanostructure.¬¬¬In conclusion, my graduate research focuses on the integration of nanowire-based structures to achieve more efficient artificial photosynthesis. This is demonstrated in this dissertation not only at system level for an intergrated nanostructure, but also at component level for advanced building blocks. This research can serve as a foundation for the efforts of other researches in the field of artificial photosynthesis.",,,,0,[],Liu,,False,

This method of growth of aligned SWNTs, which can yield well over 400 percent SWNT mass per unit substrate mass, exceeds current yields for entangled SWNT growth. In addition, processing can be performed with minimal wet etching treatments, leaving aligned SWNTs with superior properties over those that exist in entangled mats. The alignment of the nanotubes is similar to that achieved in vertically aligned nanotubes, which are called  Because these flakes are grown in a state where they are airborne in a reactor, these flakes, after growing SWNTs, are termed flying carpets.  These flakes are created in a roll-to-roll evaporator system, where three subsequent evaporations are performed on a 100-ft (approx. =30-m) roll of Mylar. The first layer is composed of a water-soluble release layer,  which can be a material such as NaCl. After depositing NaCl, the second layer involves 40 nm of supporting layer material . either Al2O3 or MgO. The thickness of the layer can be tuned to synthesize flakes that are larger or smaller than those obtained with a 40-nm deposition. Finally, the third layer consists of a thin Fe catalyst layer with a thickness of 0.5 nm. The thickness of this layer ultimately determines the diameter of SWNT growth, and a layer that is too thick will result in the growth of multiwalled carbon nanotubes instead of single-wall nanotubes. However, between a thickness of 0.5 nm to 1 nm, single-walled carbon nanotubes are known to be the primary constituent. After this three-layer deposition process, the Mylar is rolled through a bath of water, which allows catalyst-coated flakes to detach from the Mylar. The flakes are then collected and dried. The method described here for making such flakes is analogous to that which is used to make birefringent ink that is coated on U.S. currency. After deposition, the growth is carried out in a hot-filament chemical vapor deposition apparatus. A tungsten hot filament placed in the flow of H2 at a temperature greater than 1,600 C creates atomic hydrogen, which serves to reduce the Fe catalyst into a metallic state. The catalyst can now precipitate SWNTs in the presence of growth gases. The gases used for the experiments reported are C2H2, H2O, and H2, at rates of 2, 2, and 400 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), respectively. In order to retain the flakes, a cage is constructed by spot welding stainless steel or copper mesh to form an enclosed area, in which the flakes are placed prior to growth. This allows growth gases and atomic hydrogen to reach the flakes, but does not allow the flakes, which rapidly nucleate SWNTs, to escape from the cage.",,,,0,[],Schmidt,,False,

The number of atomic planes in graphene or other ultra-thin films has to be determined very fast and over large wafer-scale areas. The previously existed methods of accurate counting of the number of atomic planes in few-layer graphene were primarily based on micro-Raman spectroscopy. These methods were local, slow, and could not be scaled up to characterize the whole wafers. In this dissertation research I proposed and developed an automatic approach for graphene inspection over the wafer-size areas. The proposed method can be scaled up for industrial use. It is based on the image processing analysis of the pseudo-color contrasts uniquely assigned to each few-layer graphene region characterized by a specific number of atomic planes. The initial calibration of the technique is performed with the help of micro-Raman spectroscopy. The image processing is also used to account for the lighting non-uniformity of the samples.

Such high electro-activities are caused by the geometric and electronic structures of the interfacial layers different from those of the bulk [1], and therefore, it is very important to know the interfacial structures with atomic dimensions. Pt ultra-thin films on foreign metal substrates are expected to be a good electro-catalyst in many reactions. Moreover, Pt is one of the most precious materials so that the loading amount of Pt as an electrocatalyst is expected to reduce. Previously, structural studies of electrochemically deposited Pt ultra-thin layers on a Au(111) single crystal electrode surface have been carried out by several groups [2-4] by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), but the results were different from each other. While Naohara et al. reported that Pt grows on an atomically flat Au(111) surface in the layer-by-layer mode [2], Waibel et al. [3] and Strbac et al. [4] reported that Pt grows on the Au(111) surface in the islanding mode. We confirmed this difference using surface X-ray scattering (SXS) [5]. The SXS technique is ideal to determine the structure of the metal deposit with atomic precision, but since the atomic number and, therefore, the scattering parameters of Pt are too close to those of Au, the interfacial structure of the Pt layer on the Au substrate cannot be precisely determined from the (00) rod data obtained using the incident energy of 11.271 keV, which is usually used in our SXS studies [6-9]. Thus, we have now demonstrated that the resonance SXS (RSXS) method, in which the incident X-ray energy close to the Pt LIII absorption edge (11.55 keV) is used so that the anomalous scattering parameter effect is utilized [5], is very useful to precisely determine the interfacial structure of the Pt layers prepared on a Au(111) surface.

Kobayashi,Energy transformation,"Designing solid-state devices is essentially limited by choosing available chemical elements found on the Periodic Table and forming various stable solid compounds made of these chemical elements. A key to developing novel solid-state devices is, therefore to find a route to combine a variety of such compounds that are often physically and/or chemically incompatible each other. In this talk, specific examples of currently pursued at Nanostructured Energy Conversion Technology and Research of Advanced Studies Laboratories, University of California Santa Cruz and NASA Ames Research Center (http://asl.ucsc.edu/contact.php), will be presented with the view toward solid-state devices for energy harvesting and saving. The talk is divided into the following two topics.

Nanostructured materials for energy harvesting (photovoltaics and thermoelectrics) Development of next-generation energy resources that are reliable and economically/environmentally acceptable is a key to harnessing and providing the resources essential for the life of mankind. Our research focuses on the development of novel nanostructured materials that would significantly benefit energy harvesting, in particular, from light and heat. In these critical applications, traditional semiconductor solid-state devices, such as photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric (TE) devices based on a stack of single-crystal semiconductor thin films or single-crystal bulk semiconductor have several drawbacks, for instance; scalability-limits when ultra-large-scale implementation is envisioned for PV devices and performance-limits for TE devices in which the interplay of both electronic and phonon systems is important. In our research, various types of nanostructured materials (e.g., nanowires and nanoparticles) coupled to or embedded within micrometer-scale semiconductor platforms are explored to build a variety of nonconventional PV and TE devices. Two core architectures are (1) single-crystal semiconductor nanowires electrically connected to amorphous semiconductor thin films and (2) semi-metallic nanoparticles embedded within a semiconductor thin film. These two architectures are studied within the context of their basic electronic, optical, and thermal properties, which will be further assessed and validated by comparison with theoretical approaches to draw comprehensive pictures of physicochemical properties of the nanostructured materials.

Nanostructured materials for energy saving (low-power electronics) Fundamental building blocks of computers for the last half century have been based on three-terminal semiconductor electronic devices (i.e., transistors). Among various transistors, silicon metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (Si-MOSFETs) are the core devices for constructing prevailing CMOS logic families. Among many technical challenges in developing advanced Si-MOSFETs, reducing excessive heat generated by high performance CMOS chips ranks high. Lowering the operational voltage for a CMOS chip is one way to reduce the total electric power consumed by a CMOS chip while the size of Si-MOSFETs is scaled down, however, the lowering the operational voltage is negated by, for instance, the increase in off-state leakage current of smaller transistors. Replacing Si-MOSFETs with other types of devices that operate in ways fundamentally different from those of Si-MOSFETs will be the ultimate approach and could lead us to pave a entirely new way to construct computers in the future. We are currently developing unique two-terminal devices, resisters with memory functions memristors, fabricated in sub-viral length scales to build memory and logic devices that can be operated at ultra-low power. A wide range of metal oxides that have been known to exhibit a variety of electrical properties including insulating, semiconducting, and metallic are used as core materials for memristors. Precise and reproducible control on thickness and chemical composition of metal oxide thin films is one of the critical factors in the fabrication of memristors. Among various fabrication techniques, we are currently employing atomic layer deposition (ALD) to develop variety of metal oxide thin films for memristors.",international conference on signal processing,,conference,0,[],Kobayashi,,False,

Proximity based interactions between nearby systems (i.e. films, adsorbates, molecules) and candidate spintronic materials (i.e. GaAs, graphene) could lead to the realization of novel phenomena. Such effects, which rely on atomic orbital overlap, require highly controlled surfaces and interfaces which can be achieved using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Here, this dissertation examines the feasibility of integrating high quality single crystal ferromagnetic insulators with oxide interfaces, the semiconductor GaAs, and graphene. Graphene, a single atomic layer of sp 2 bonded carbon with conducting &pi orbitals that extend out of the plane, is highly surface sensitive and can be considered an ideal material for investigating novel spin-based proximity related behavior. In particular, the interactions of functional oxides or adsorbates with graphene could lead to induced exchange splitting, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling. High quality crystalline deposition of the ferromagnetic insulator EuO is investigated with the primary focus of realizing high quality abrupt interfaces between the functional oxide and the spintronic material of choice. In this dissertation, stiochiometric EuO films are investigated on a wide variety of substrates including the spintronic relavent materials GaAs, 2-D planes of TiO2, and sp 2 bonded carbon. The integration of EuO on these materials is a key advance towards experimental observation of the exchange proximity effect.The atomic scale control over deposition provided by MBE allows for the investigation of submonolayer adsorbates (adatoms) and their interactions with graphene. In order to understand the effect of the adsorbates on spin-based properties and phenomena, we have performed systematic in-situ deposition of adatoms onto graphene non-local spin valves. Atomic hydrogen induces magnetic moments in graphene that couple via exchange to the injected spin current. This coupling results in an exchange field which causes the spins to precess rapidly with an effectively enhanced electron g -factor. These results demonstrate the power of molecular beam epitaxy in realizing novel graphene properties and functionality through careful control over the key interfaces and proximity materials.",,,,0,[],Swartz,,False,

Quintanilla, José Manuel Valverde, M. J. Espin","Agglomerate, Fluidization, Particle (ecology), Two-dimensional gas","Usually, nanopowders are characterized by the existence of large agglomerates of nanoparticles (NPs), whose size and density determine the fluidizability of the powder. The system studied in this work is a silica nanopowder fluidized in a polycarbonate vessel. We show results from a noninvasive visualization technique able to automatically track NP agglomerate trajectories in the fluidized bed excited by an externally applied alternating field. This technique enables us to measure NP agglomerate properties such as their size, charge, and density. In this work the behavior of a dry-fluidized bed of silica nanopowder as affected by an externally imposed electric field has been studied. Because of contact and tribo charging mechanisms, the NP agglomerates naturally accumulate sufficient electrostatic charge to be appreciably excited by electrostatic fields of strength on the order of 1 kV/cm. A main result from a statistical analysis based on particle tracking velocimetry is that NP agglomerates may carry an electrostatic charge in the fluidized bed up to 100 fC, which is attributable to the large specific surface area of nanopowders and to the high level of charge transfer between silica and the polymeric wall. INTRODUCTION Gas bubbles usually developed in gas-fluidized beds of coarse grains (grain size of the order and larger than 100 microns) serve as a bypass for the gas, which hampers the gas-solids contact efficiency. In contrast, gas-fluidized beds of some micron and sub-micron particles exhibit a nonbubbling fluidlike behavior. For example, powders of moderate density NPs, such as silica NPs, can be fluidized by a gas. Fluidization of NPs, providing extremely high specific surface area, has become thus a subject of research interest in the last years. NP fluidization has been successfully applied in processes involving low gas velocities. The use of fluidized beds of titania NPs has been proposed to remove pollutant nitrogen oxides from air by photocatalytic reaction. Fluidization of Co/Al2O3 NPs has been shown to be useful to improve the catalytic activity of reforming methane with CO2. Another example is Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), which has been successfully carried out in NP fluidized beds to coat NPs with ultra-thin layers of functional. Large-scale processes, involving NP fluidization, currently employed in industry, are the production of fumed metal oxides, such as fumed silica, and carbon black materials. See van Ommen et al. (1) for an extensive recent review on fluidization of nanopowders. Unfortunately, most nanopowders cannot be uniformly fluidized, thus hampering the efficiency of industry processes relying on the potentially high gas-solids contact surface provided by NPs. Various methods to assist fluidization of nanopowders have been proposed which are useful in either mobilizing or disrupting large and compact agglomerates formed during storage. These methods include vibration, stirring, sound waves; pulsed flow, centrifugal fields, electric fields, and secondary gas flow from a microjet (van Ommen et al. (1)). In this work we report on the use of a non-invasive direct visualization technique to track NP agglomerate trajectories and measure their size, density, and electrostatic charge. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PROCEDURE The nanopowder tested is Aerosil R974 supplied from Evonik Industries, which consists of hydrophobic silica NPs (particle density 2250 kg/m and particle size 12 nm). The nanopowder is pre-sieved (sieve opening of 425 microns) and initialized in the fluidization cell by applying a sufficiently high gas velocity (3 cm/s). The dynamics of NP agglomerates was investigated by automatic tracking NP agglomerates in the vicinity of the free surface. The visualization technique used consisted of laser-based planar imaging as described elsewhere (Wng et al. (2), Valverde et al. (3)). The experimental setup for this purpose is illustrated in Figure 1, where a rectangular polycarbonate bed (4.5x 2.5 cm cross-section). Agglomerate size was directly obtained by means of digital image analysis while agglomerate charge and density were obtained by fitting the experimental trajectories to the trajectories theoretically predicted for a uniformly charged sphere of diameter equal to the measured agglomerate size.

Among all the approaches considered to increase the area density, reducing the magnetic spacing is an effective solution that directly impacts the thickness and quality of the carbon overcoat. One of the methods of carbon overcoat deposition is chemical vapor deposition, which uses carbon-containing precursor gases as the source of carbon radicals and atoms to form the carbon overcoat. The produced carbon film is characterized by high hydrogen content (20%-50%), depending on the carbon-to-hydrogen ratio of the precursor gas and process parameters. Because of the hydrogen content, CVD-deposited hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) deposited by CVD exhibit density of 1.7-2.2 g/cm 3 , which is much lower than the density (~3 g/cm 3 ) of hydrogen-free amorphous carbon (a-C) films deposited by filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA).The superior nanomechanical/tribological properties of FCVA-deposited a-C films have been widely-reported; however, most studies have examined relatively thick (tens of nanometers) a-C films, while current demands require much thinner films of thickness in the range of 1-4 nm. FCVA-deposited a-C films overcoats are desirable protective overcoats for HDDs provided they can maintain their demonstrated high quality even for thickness as low as 1 nm. In this dissertation, an in-depth study of the structure of FCVA-deposited a-C films deposited on silicon was carried out using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and analytical electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Both low- and high (core)-loss EELS spectra of Si and C were analyzed to determine the elemental content and through-thickness structure of ~20-nm-thick a-C films. Calculations of atomic carbon hybridization based on EELS spectra were used to track the film structure evolution. The average content of carbon hybridization in the top few nanometers of the a-C film, determined from EELS analysis, was found to be ~50%, much less than 73% of the bulk film. This multilayer structure was also validated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results indicate that the minimum thickness of a-C films deposited by the FCVA method under conditions of optimum substrate bias (-100 V) should be equal to 3-3.5 nm, which is the total thickness of the buffer and surface layers. The effects of other important FCVA process parameters on film growth were also investigated to explore the prospect of further decreasing the a-C film thickness. The incidence angle effect of energetic C+ ions bombarding onto the growing film surface was studied in terms of the deposition rate, topography, and film structure. Cross-section TEM measurements combined with Monte Carlo (T-DYN) simulations revealed that the deposition yield (rate) is independent of the ion fluence but varies with the incidence angle according to a relationship derived from sputtering theory. XPS and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies were also performed to examine carbon hybridization and film topography. The optimum incidence angle for FCVA deposition was found equal to 45 o . A relatively new technology that shows potential for further breakthroughs in magnetic recording is heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). This technology utilizes a tightly focused laser beam to heat and temporarily reduce the coercivity of magnetic nanodomains below that of the magnetic field applied by the magnetic head. Impulsive laser heating (typically 3 content due to RTA, indicating that oxidization and graphitization of the a-C:H films was either secondary or negligible during RTA. However, Raman spectra showed significant changes with annealing temperature increasing above 450 o C. Hydrogen depletion, the increase of the sp 2 cluster size, and the enhancement of carbon network ordering are the most likely factors affecting the structural stability of the a-C:H films. The obtained results suggest that the structural stability of a-C:H films deposited on current hard disks by PECVD can be preserved, provided they are not heated to temperatures above ~400 °C during the read/write operation process of HAMR HDDs.In addition to the above experimental studies, molecular dynamics simulations were also performed to study the growth mechanism of a-C film due to an atom-by-atom deposition process, which is physically close to the real FCVA deposition process. Using the second-generation reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential, a-C films with different structures were simulated by varying the carbon atom incident energy in the range of 1-120 eV. Atomic hybridization and ring connectivity were used to study the film microstructure. A multi-layer film structure consisting of an intermixing layer, bulk film, and surface layer was observed for relatively high carbon atom deposition energy, in agreement with the subplantation model. The highest film density (3.3 g/cm 3 ) and sp 3 fraction (~43%) and best intermediate-range order were obtained for ~80 eV incident energy, which is in good agreement with experimental findings.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1552338433', 'https://openalex.org/W177459265', 'https://openalex.org/W1964980820', 'https://openalex.org/W1967387078', 'https://openalex.org/W1969845360', 'https://openalex.org/W1971802197', 'https://openalex.org/W1972782897', 'https://openalex.org/W1973579234', 'https://openalex.org/W1977348941', 'https://openalex.org/W1988614045', 'https://openalex.org/W1998223130', 'https://openalex.org/W1999841847', 'https://openalex.org/W2009077938', 'https://openalex.org/W2014632653', 'https://openalex.org/W2015076719', 'https://openalex.org/W2015110181', 'https://openalex.org/W2016139406', 'https://openalex.org/W2017272049', 'https://openalex.org/W2019195610', 'https://openalex.org/W2019465613', 'https://openalex.org/W2019481672', 'https://openalex.org/W2021407985', 'https://openalex.org/W2023616054', 'https://openalex.org/W2023917386', 'https://openalex.org/W2028448252', 'https://openalex.org/W2029704598', 'https://openalex.org/W2032508930', 'https://openalex.org/W2033265858', 'https://openalex.org/W2034684339', 'https://openalex.org/W2035266068', 'https://openalex.org/W2035945299', 'https://openalex.org/W2036703856', 'https://openalex.org/W2036891129', 'https://openalex.org/W2036950717', 'https://openalex.org/W2037439845', 'https://openalex.org/W2038513753', 'https://openalex.org/W2038655661', 'https://openalex.org/W2040264838', 'https://openalex.org/W2041902442', 'https://openalex.org/W2048334148', 'https://openalex.org/W2048690329', 'https://openalex.org/W2049842476', 'https://openalex.org/W2052444884', 'https://openalex.org/W2053690304', 'https://openalex.org/W2054543876', 'https://openalex.org/W2058440725', 'https://openalex.org/W2062654303', 'https://openalex.org/W2063775779', 'https://openalex.org/W2064467938', 'https://openalex.org/W2071855958', 'https://openalex.org/W2072783500', 'https://openalex.org/W2073670197', 'https://openalex.org/W2078421142', 'https://openalex.org/W2081477542', 'https://openalex.org/W2085168268', 'https://openalex.org/W2086529087', 'https://openalex.org/W2089270050', 'https://openalex.org/W2092165519', 'https://openalex.org/W2103277250', 'https://openalex.org/W2109155781', 'https://openalex.org/W2110167104', 'https://openalex.org/W2112387402', 'https://openalex.org/W2119999214', 'https://openalex.org/W2123125078', 'https://openalex.org/W2124310574', 'https://openalex.org/W2131869735', 'https://openalex.org/W2137104286', 'https://openalex.org/W2137250615', 'https://openalex.org/W2141308879', 'https://openalex.org/W2147415793', 'https://openalex.org/W2156236051', 'https://openalex.org/W2159174698', 'https://openalex.org/W2159352990', 'https://openalex.org/W2331505411', 'https://openalex.org/W2568872239']",Wang,,False,

The growth window for PZT film or nanowire was systematically studied at varied temperatures and pressures. The proposed growth mechanism of the taper PZT NWAs was investigated from a layer by layer growth via FrankVan Der Merwe growth, followed by a formation of three- dimensional islands via StranskiKrastanow growth, and then axial growth on the lowest energy (001) plane with growth direction of (001) via vaporsolid growth mechanism.

A highly ordered Pt(111)-(√3 × √7)-Cu + HSO4 - structure due to underpotentially deposited Cu monolayer was observed in 1 M H2SO4 + 1 mM CuSO4. This adlattice restructured upon the introduction of polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 200) and chloride anions. At the onset potential for bulk Cu deposition (~0V), a Pt(111) - (√3 × √3)R30° - Cu + Cl- structure was imaged with a tunneling current of 0.5 nA. Lowering the tunneling current to 0.2 nA yielded a (4 × 4) structure, presumably due to adsorbed PEG200 molecules. The subsequent nucleation and deposition processes of Cu in solution containing PEG and Cl- were examined, revealing nucleation of 2-3 nm wide CuCl clusters on an atomically smooth Pt(111) surface at overpotentials less than 50 mV. With larger overpotential (η > 150 mV), Cu deposition seemed to bypass the production of CuCl species, leading to layered Cu deposition, starting preferentially at step defects, followed by lateral growth to cover the entire Pt electrode surface. These processes were observed with both PEG200 and 4000, although the former tended to produce more CuCl nanoclusters. Raising [H2SO4] to 1 M substantiate the suppressing effect of PEG on Cu deposition. It could observe different structures along with the the copper growing layer by layer. On the first layer the chloride adlayer produced a double-lined pattern, followed by a moire pattern along with minor triangular depressions seen with Cl adsorbed on the second layer of metal film. Copper atoms would have to occupy different sites on the Pt substrate, yielding unlike corrugation heights of the adsorbed chloride adatoms. To decipher the effects of organic additives on the electrodeposition of copper, I employed in situ STM to reveal the surface morphology of Cu deposit and the dynamics of this event. The electrode was made of multilayer Cu on Pt(111). The base electrolyte used in this study was 1 M H2SO4 + 0.1 mM CuSO4 + 1 mM HCl. The organic additives used were PEG4000, PEG8000, and SPS. Results obtained with PEG4000 showed that Cu was deposited uniformly on the electrode, except at the perimeters of depressed features or pits. Presumably, PEG4000 admolecules assumed coiled structures on the electrode surface, including terraces and pits. In comparison, perimeters of pits were less likely to be covered by PEG molecules and thus were more open to Cu deposit. With more Cu deposition, the resultant surface morphology became rougher than the pristine Cu surface. In the presence of SPS alone, Cu deposit grew in 2D, producing flake like features whose edges were apparently rugged, suggesting that SPS molecules, rather than chloride, were the most important adspecies on the Cu deposit. It is thought that pits in the Cu substrate might not be entirely filled, leading to voids in the Cu fillings. In the end, only the combination of PEG and SPS was able to guide the deposition of Cu at depressions in the Cu substrate. Judged from the results seen with PEG4000 and 8000, the latter was superior in inhibiting Cu deposition.",,,,0,[],傅筠琳,,False,

Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are one of the most relevant functionalization approaches to achieve selectivity in the sensing processes. Although the optimization of these organic films has received considerable attention, most of the functionalization routes have focused on the coating of sensors with relative large areas. The downscaling of the SAMs to small nano-devices, such as Si and poly SiGe NEMS and MEMS-based sensors, requires additional tools, both for their selective deposition and characterization. In this work, two main approaches to selective Si nanowires functionalization are being investigated: i) selective Joule heating ablation of the protective polymer layer on the suspended NW surface, and ii) e-beam lithography to open the resist layer on the NW area. In a following step, a NH2-SAM layer is deposited on the unprotected silicon oxide surface and glutaraldehyde molecules are used as a linker between the SAM amino functionality and biotin.

The second structure under investigation uses a lead selenide layer for the IR absorption. In the interferometric structure, a new epoxy material SU8-2002 was used as a dielectric medium. This material has a very low thermal conductivity of 0.3 W/mK, which makes it suitable for thermal detectors.

After deposition, a rapid thermal anneal (RTA) in nitrogen (N2) ambient was then performed at 550 or 850℃. The crystalline phases and morphologies of the high-k films after RTA were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, respectively.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized to confirm the microstructures of the CeO2 and CeAlO insulators and their interfacial layers formed in contact with the Si-substrates. According to XRD, CeO2 films are amorphous after 550℃ annealing but are crystallized after 850℃ annealing. Moreover, as annealing temperature increases from 550 to 850℃, both the dielectric constant and gate leakage current of CeO2 films decrease. This phenomenon is attributed to a thicker interfacial layer (Ce-silicate) formed after a higher temperature RTA, which is confirmed by XRD, XPS, and TEM. On the other hand, CeAlO films remain amorphous after 850℃ annealing, indicating that the incorporation of Al into CeO2 suppresses the crystallization. Furthermore, as the O2/Ar ratio during film deposition increases from 0:5 to 3:5, the dielectric constant increases and the gate leakage current decreases. This behavior is consistent with the oxygen vacancy model. In conclusion, electrical and material properties of CeO2 and CeAlO gate insulators have been measured and compared. The addition of Al into CeO2 can raise crystallization temperature.

Two methods were used for fabricating the Pd/Cu membranes so that the sulfur tolerant fcc alloy would remain on the surface and minimize the decrease in hydrogen permeance inherent with fcc Pd/Cu alloys. The first method consisted of annealing a Pd/Cu bi-layer at high-temperatures and the second consisted of depositing a Pd/Cu/Pd tri-layer with an ultra-thin surface alloy. High temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) was employed to study the kinetics of the annealing process and atomic adsorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used to investigate the kinetics of the Cu deposition and Pd displacement of Cu. Upon the introduction of H2S, the permeance decrease observed was dependent upon the H2S feed concentration, and not the time of poisoning. However, after the recovery in pure H2 there was a portion of the permeance which could not be recovered due to adsorbed sulfur blocking H2 adsorption sites. The amount of recoverable permeance was dependent on the time of exposure to H2S and reached a limiting value which decreased with temperature. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate poisoned samples and it was observed that the permeance not recovered at a given temperature in H2 was caused mostly by Cu sulfides.

For silicon, the only commercial ALD high-k fabrication process, which avoids processing induced damage, is a replacement gate process (a type of gate-last process). While preparing silicon for gate-last processing is straightforward, the key to a gate-last process for III -V semiconductors is the order and cleanliness of the III- V channel prior to dielectric deposition. Aggressive oxide thickness reduction (equivalent oxide thickness, or EOT, scaling) is needed to fabricate small gate length devices with small subthreshold swings. Furthermore, aggressive EOT scaling requires a very high uniform ALD nucleation density, with no pinholes due to surface contaminants. The key barrier to solving a very practical problem is a surface chemistry challenge: develop a chemical process which removes nearly all air induced defects and contaminants and leaves the III-V surface flat and electrically active for high nucleation density ALD gate oxide deposition, which unpins the Fermi level. The following study uses scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to observe the removal of the oxide layer and restoration of the clean InGaAs surface reconstruction with atomic hydrogen cleaning, allowing for a gate-last or replacement-gate process. Along with surface cleaning STM and STS was used to characterize the initial passivation of InGaAs surfaces via ALD of trimethyl aluminum (TMA). The substrate temperature and initial surface reconstruction was critical to forming an unpinned passivation layer with a high nucleation density.

These nanostructures should work as models for the implementation of new data storage applications which should be realized with the controlled motion of magnetic domain walls. Anodic alumina membranes are utilized as templates in which mild and hard anodizations were combined to yield modulations in pore diameter. These diameter modulations should act as nucleation points for the controlled pinning and depinning of domain walls. Nanowires are fabricated by electrodeposition and nanotubes by atomic layer deposition(ALD). Their magnetic properties strongly depend on the presence of diameter modulations both on the ensemble scale and at the single-object level. Theoretical modeling emphasize the major influence of the magnetostatic interactions between neighboring wires and tubes.
In the first section, nickel nanowires are presented. In single-object measurements it is possible to observe hints of domain wall pinning in some cases. That the pinning occurs at the modulation remain to be shown and should be shown in future studies. Additionally, in the nanowires presented here the pinning is not systematic. Most likely, the energy difference of a domain wall between thick and thin wire segments is too small with respect to the influence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and thermal fluctuations. Such factors would introduce a stochastic component into the pinning phenomena. Further, the presence of modulations also affect the magnetic properties of wire ensembles. In a simple theoretical framework it is possible to account for the differences between the various types of modulated wires and calculate their enhanced interaction in the array. The model show limitations for multiple modulations: it is considered this as a likely sign that the diameter modulations influence either the nucleation domain boundaries or their propagation.

It is shown, that also here designed structural irregularities have consequences of prime importance on the magnetic characteristics of the tubes as in nanowires.

The method of synthesizing large-area graphene with good quality is critical for its potential applications. This dissertation reports a new synthesis method of using a home built thermal cracker enhanced gas source molecular beam epitaxy (GSMBE) system. Chapter 2 discusses graphene growth using nickel substrate in the GSMBE system. Hydrocarbon gas molecules were broken by thermal cracker at very high temperature of 1200°C and then impinged on a nickel substrate. High-quality, large-area graphene films were achieved at 800°C, and this was confirmed by both Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A rapid cooling rate was not required for few-layer graphene growth in this method, and a high-percentage single layer and bilayer graphene films were grown by controlling the growth time. The results suggest that in this method, carbon atoms migrate on the nickel surface and bond with each other to form graphene. Few-layer graphene is formed by subsequent growth of carbon layers on top of existing graphene layers. This is completely different from graphene formation through carbon dissolving in nickel and then precipitating from the nickel during rapid substrate cooling in the chemical vapor deposition method. Chapter 3 further discusses using cobalt as graphene growth substrate. Growth conditions including growth temperature and growth time play important roles in the resulting morphology of as-grown films. A narrow growth time window was found for different growth temperatures. Carbon absorption and desorption phenomena were responsible for temperature-dependent and growth time-dependent graphene morphology. Fast cooling rate was not required in this process due to direct growth mechanism under atomic carbon growth condition. Large-area graphene films with high single-layer and bi-layer coverage of 93% were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy.Graphene based flash memory was demonstrated by using nickel nanocrystals as storage nodes in chapter 4. First, the graphene channel with a dimension of a 20 µm × 5 µm was acquired by photolithography and oxygen plasma etching. Then, the gate stack formed by the deposition of tunneling oxide, nickel nanocrystal and block oxide. On/off operation of the transistor memory was acquired by static pulse response measurement. The memory window of the device was found up to be 23.1 V by back gate sweep. This memory effect is attributed to charging/discharging of nanocrystals. Furthermore, excellent retention and endurance performance were achieved. Chapter 5 demonstrated a memory capacitor with an embedded graphene nano dots structure.

Hillman,"Tellurium, Thallium","AbstractThe Electrodeposition of PbTe Nanowires for Thermoelectric ApplicationsbyPeter HillmanDoctor of Philosophy in ChemistryUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Angelica Stacy, Chair The electrodeposition of PbTe nanowires for thermoelectric applications is presented in this thesis. The Pb-Te electrochemical system was investigated to determine the optimal conditions for deposition. It was found that citric acid complexed tellurium in solution shifting its reduction potential cathodically. The shift in reduction potential led to the deposition of pure PbTe without any observable excess tellurium. Nanowires of PbTe were doped p-type and n-type through the addition of thallium and indium to the plating solution. Indium-doped nanowire arrays showed a linear relation between lattice parameter and atomic percent indium confirming successful incorporation. The lattice parameter trend in thallium-doped nanowire arrays was linear only after annealing. In the case of thallium doping, thallium tellurides were formed, which upon annealing formed a solid solution with PbTe. The results of the thallium doping study led to the investigation of the Tl-Te electrochemical system. Cyclic voltammagrams were used to determine the deposition mechanism of TlTe and Tl5Te3. Thin films and nanowire arrays of these compounds were deposited. This was the first study of the electrochemical Tl-Te system and the first report of the electrodeposition of TlTe and Tl5Te3. Thermoelectric measurements were conducted on thin films and nanowire arrays of PbTe. The Seebeck coefficient and resistivity of PbTe thin film were measured. Results from thin films were complicated by the Pt substrate on which PbTe was deposited. Subtracting the effects of the Pt layer suggested PbTe thin films could have a large zT, however further work is needed to confirm this result. Resistivity measurements on nanowire arrays were also conducted. Despite efforts to minimize the oxidation of PbTe nanowires, good electrical contacts could not be created. The resistivity of nanowire arrays were orders of magnitude higher than expected. As a result of their low conductivity, the thermoelectric efficiency of PbTe nanowires were negliglable. Nanotube arrays of conductive polyaniline were synthesized through the electrochemical deposition into porous anodic alumina. PbTe nanowires were deposited into these nanotubes to create a PbTe/polyaniline core-shell structure. PbTe/polyaniline hybrids should have a lower thermal conductivity than pure PbTe. Measurements of PbTe/polyaniline core-shell nanowires are still needed to confirm the predicted lower thermal conductivity.",,,,0,[],Hillman,,False,

PL and XPS also showed that the acceptor-like defects, such as zinc vacancies and oxygen interstitials, increased in films prepared by an fraction of 0.9, resulting in the p-type conductivity in the films. Hall results indicated that AZO films prepared by fractions in range of 0 - 0.6 can be used for electrode layers in the applications of transparent thin film transistor. We concluded from the X-ray diffraction analysis that worse crystallinity with a smaller grain size as well as higher tensile stress was observed in the films prepared by a higher fraction, which is related to incorporation of more oxygen atoms into the films during deposition.

It is optically transparent and has high electron mobility, and thus has great potential to make transparent conductive electrodes. This invention contributes towards the development of graphene transparent conductive electrodes for next-generation microshutter arrays. The original design for the electrodes of the next generation of microshutters uses indium-tin-oxide (ITO) as the electrode material. ITO is widely used in NASA flight missions. The optical transparency of ITO is limited, and the material is brittle. Also, ITO has been getting more expensive in recent years. The objective of the invention is to develop a graphene transparent conductive electrode that will replace ITO. An exfoliation procedure was developed to make graphene out of graphite crystals. In addition, large areas of single-layer graphene were produced using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) with high optical transparency. A special graphene transport procedure was developed for transferring graphene from copper substrates to arbitrary substrates. The concept is to grow large-size graphene sheets using the LPCVD system through chemical reaction, transfer the graphene film to a substrate, dope graphene to reduce the sheet resistance, and pattern the film to the dimension of the electrodes in the microshutter array. Graphene transparent conductive electrodes are expected to have a transparency of 97.7%. This covers the electromagnetic spectrum from UV to IR. In comparison, ITO electrodes currently used in microshutter arrays have 85% transparency in mid-IR, and suffer from dramatic transparency drop at a wavelength of near-IR or shorter.

This requires the characterization of CNTs after synthesis. It is shown by high-resolution TEM and Raman spectroscopy that the diameter distribution and number of layers of as-grown CNTs depends on the growth temperature TCVD.
HRTEM measurements are seen to induce defects, even when performed at electron energies as low as 80 keV. Raman spectroscopy, on the other hand, is non-destructive for individual CNTs at small laser intensities (P < 0.5mW). This fact motivated us to attempt a correlation of HRTEM and Raman spectroscopy, which allowed us to prove the radial phonon-coupling for an individual multi-walled CNT and a bundle of single-walled CNTs for the first time experimentally and to confirm our results by a simple numeric model. Furthermore, it could be shown that the width of the resonance profiles of radial Raman modes allows one to determine whether the investigated CNT is an individual single-walled CNT, located within a bundle or a layer of a multi-walled CNT. This makes a determination of the inter-molecular structure of CNTs possible without damaging the CNTs by TEM imaging. Moreover, resonant
Raman spectroscopy provides important information about the electronic structure of the investigated CNTs, which is essential for interpreting future quantum transport
measurements and permits the determination of the atomic structure of individual CNTs.

Vesicles of charged amphiphilic block copolymers have been utilized for fabrication of biomimetic membranes that exhibit properties similar to those of biological cell membranes but with exceptional durability and mechanical strength. Such membranes are suitable for embedding proteins/enzymes for various industrial applications.In this work, amphiphilic block copolymers of complementary charges are used in a cascade self-assembly process that involves sequential formation of vesicles in solution and their fusion on a charged substrate. Each copolymer chain links a strong polyelectrolyte (hydrophilic) block with a hydrophobic polymer that provides the driving force of the vesicle self-assembly in an aqueous environment. Biomimetic membranes are formed by layer-by-layer deposition/fusion of oppositely charged vesicles at a strongly charged mica surface. The cascade self-assembly process allows us to have a precise control of the membrane microscopic structure, thickness and composition. We have identified optimal solution conditions for formation of various mesoscopic block copolymer structures. The morphologies of cationic and anionic block copolymer structures at dry and at wet conditions are characterized by, respectively, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Moreover, the thicknesses of these biomimetic membranes on the substrate have been measured by AFM scratching experiments. While the practical utility of these biomimetic membranes is yet to be demonstrated, this work provides deeper understanding of the size variation and spreading of amphiphilic block copolymer vesicles on mica surface and the selection of appropriate conditions for membrane fabrication.",,,,0,[],Tseng,,False,

In this work, three electrochemical deposition techniques were used in the preparation of CuInS2 thin films namely potentiostatic deposition, pulse electrodeposition and potentiodynamic deposition. CuInS2 thin films were deposited onto fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO) from deposition bath comprised of Cu-EDTA, In2(SO4)3 and Na2S2O3, and the pH was adjusted to ~2.30 by using sulfuric acid. A three electrode-cell was used, where Ag/AgCl/3M NaCl as the reference electrode, FTO as the working electrode and platinum wire as the counterelectrode. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the probable range of deposition potential and the potential range obtained was at -0.80 V to -1.00 V. Deposition parameters such as potential (-0.85 V to -1.20 V), time (10 min to 50 min), pulse magnitude (-0.85 V to -1.20 V), duty cycle (10% to 90%), scan rate (5mV/s to 40 mV/s), potential cycling (5 cycles to 50 cycles), concentration of CuSO4 (0.004 M to 0.020 M), concentration of In2(SO4)3 (0.004 M to 0.020 M) and annealing temperature (250 oC to 400 oC ) were studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed that the deposited CuInS2 films were polycrystalline with tetragonal structure at hkl planes of (200), (112) and (204). The photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the films were evaluated using linear sweep photovoltammetry by intermittently illuminating the samples which was immersed in 0.01 M Na2S2O3 electrolyte with a halogen lamp (120 V 300 W). Photocurrent was observed due to cathodic reaction involving generated minority carriers of electrons. Thus, CuInS2 is a p-type semiconductor as deposited in this study. The XRD and PEC results suggested the suitable electrolyte bath composition for CuInS2 deposition was 0.01 M Cu-EDTA, 0.01 M In2(SO4)3 and 0.40 M Na2S2O3. A smooth adherent film was obtained at potential -1.00 V with deposition time of 30 min in potentiostatic deposition. While for pulse electrodeposition, pulse potential of -1.00 V at 50% duty cycle showed good PEC behaviour. Besides, for potentiodynamic deposition, a significant PEC effect was obtained at potential range of -0.40 V to -1.00 V with scan rate of 25 mV/s for 20 cycles. Annealing improved the film crystallinity, but caused the formation of impurity phases and resulted in poor photoresponse. The band gap energy of samples prepared by these techniques was found to be within 1.20-1.40 eV with indirect transition. The surface roughness mean squares of 218.60 nm, 74.73 nm and 93.30 nm were respectively obtained for potentiostatic, pulse and potentiodynamic deposition as examined using atomic force microscopy. The morphology of the films was further studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Based on SEM cross sectional images, the thicknesses of potentiostatic, pulse and potentiodynamic deposited films were estimated to be 5.06 μm, 1.55 μm and 3.32 μm respectively. From FESEM and TEM, the obtained grain shape varied from spherical to worm like for potentiostatic, pulse and potentiodynamic deposition. The crystallite sizes estimated from XRD, FESEM and TEM were 24.27-29.59 nm for potentiostatic technique, 40.45-47.08 nm for pulse electrodeposition and 31.93-36.41 nm for potentiodynamic deposition. The Cu:In:S compositions of the films were evaluated using energy dispersive X-ray analysis which resulted in 1.0:1.1:2.1, 1.1:1.0:1.8 and 1.2:1.0:1.7 respectively for potentiostatic, pulse and potentiodynamic deposition. The reasons for these compositional trends are elaborated in the text. Cyclic voltammetry was run to investigate the electrochemical properties of the films in various supporting electrolytes (NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4, KCl, K2SO4), concentration (0.01 M to 2.00 M), pH (1.35 to 10.00) and potential cycling (1 cycle to 10 cycles).

CNTs are generally produced by three methods; laser ablation, arc discharge and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [1]. Among these methods, CVD is a promising and cost effective process for the large scale production [2]. Moreover, it is possible to produce aligned at low temperatures. CVD process is based on the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon source on the metal loaded substrate. Mesoporous materials, specifically FSM-16, are favorable candidates for the CNTs production with their unique properties such as large surface areas and high thermal stability [3]. Approaching the desired electronic properties of CNTs depends on certain parameters; catalyst, carbon precursor, synthesis temperature, reaction time, and atmosphere.

These surface modifications impart unique characteristics and are therefore playing an increasingly important role in a wide variety of applications. The ability to customise each of the head groups and the tail groups of the monolayer-forming molecules permits unique opportunities for producing surface-engineered constructs and, importantly, for a better understanding of a wide range of areas such as of self-assembly, structure-property relationships and interfacial phenomena. The self-assembling technique provides an elegant method for providing the essential electrical connection between an organic molecule and a conducting surface when constructing an organic based system as an alternative system to the existing silicon-based system. The research presented in this thesis represents a significant advance in the methods used to produce and verify chemically pure SAMs. The work evolved from initial studies of a molecular rectifying system consisting of an ultra-thin donor-acceptor bilayer. The construction of the bilayer was a two-step process, the self-assembly of the sp-Bipy acceptor layer onto a gold substrate followed by the ionic coupling of the second CuPhS donor layer. A successful method was established for consistently producing chemically pure or pristine monolayers of perfluoro-octyl-thiolate (F8) SAMs on gold substrates devoid of the adventitious species. The SAM quality was assessed by comparing the relative atomic ratios calculated from high-resolution XPS data with the theoretical stoichiometric ratios, for all elements contained in the molecule including the carbon region where adventitious species are prevalent. For a SAM to be deemed pristine, the experimentally derived ratios (XPS data) were required to be within 5% of the stoichiometric ratios. SAMs deliberately contaminated with adventitious species showed that even lengthy exposure times to the depositing solution failed to remove the adventitious species and therefore co-existed with the monolayer molecules in the interfacial region. XPS was extensively employed to characterise two different SAMs. These two monolayers were assembled under identical conditions to those determined for the production of pristine F8 SAMs on gold substrates, derived from acetylated precursors. One SAM was the foundation layer of the original bilayer rectifier, sp-Bipy and the other was a closely related compound E sp-Bipy [deacetylated (E)-1,2-[N,N'-bis(3-acetylsulfanylpropyl)-4,4’-di(pyridin-4-yl)]. The resulting monolayers were considered to be pristine if the experimental ratios for all their moieties (except oxygen) and were within 10% or better (with the majority being within 2%) of the theoretical stoichiometric ratios. The modified interface predictably consisted of the bipyridinium cation for sp-Bipy SAMs and the dipyridinyl ethene cation for E sp-Bipy SAMs. However, for both SAMs the interfacial region also contained water molecules, ethanoic anions (the unavoidable co-adsorption of the deprotection product) and iodine molecules. Therefore the iodide anion was absent in the interfacial region and unexpectedly not the counter ion for the nitrogen quaternary cation. The possible substitute counter ion could be the ethanoic anion or hydroxide anion or both. These conclusions could not have been made without the prior establishment of the pristine status of the SAMs. The morphology of di-thiol SAMs (sp-Bipy and E sp-Bipy) produced from changing the deposition conditions were determined from the intensity of the two S 2p doublet peaks corresponding to the thiolate and thiol (or disulfide) moieties. For the sp-Bipy SAMs, three possible morphologies were established; bridge phase (thiolate only) from a maximum one minute exposure, upright phase (equal thiolate and thiol) from exposure time of 30 minutes, and multi-layered (excess thiol peak) from lengthy exposure times. In contrast, E sp-Bipy SAMs containing a double bond between the pyridinium rings maintained the bridge conformation under longer periods of up to approximately 30 minutes exposure to the depositing solution. Deposition times greater than 30 minutes produced upright conformation until the multi-layered conformation was formed after longer deposition times. The determination of these conformation regimes prior to production of a modified interface would be essential for all di-thiol SAMs. XPS analysis of the volatile and malodorous thiol solids and the liquid acetyl F8 precursor, using cold stage proved to be invaluable. This information aided in determining the binding energy values of the different moieties in the molecules and from binding energy values the existence if any, of impurities in the original material. XPS analysis of SAM-forming materials is an essential procedural step for the successful production of pristine SAMs and for aiding the characterisation of the resulting SAM through thorough knowledge of the typical binding energy values for each moiety. The low binding energy S 2p3/2 peak at approximately 161.2 eV was only detected after long exposure times for the thiol compounds containing conjugated pyridine / triazole. Results obtained show that this peak is the result of the secondary adsorption of the zwitterionic form of the monolayer-forming molecule at lengthy exposure times of greater than one hour",,,,0,[],Ford,,False,

Introduction Heterojunctions based on A III B VI stratified semiconductors and their (A III B VI ) oxides, as well as oxide heterojunctions with I-II group metals optically transparent in a wide wavelength region, occupy a special place in the physics of semiconductor devices. The weak cohesion between the packings allows the cleavage of the single crystals as lamellae (parallel planes) having perfect surfaces at the atomic scale. This property, along with low concentration of the surface density of states, classify these materials as ideal objects for the elaboration of a large variety of optoelectronic devices, such as detectors of ionizing radiation, photodiodes, photovoltaic cells, and many other [1-6]. The photosensitivity curve of gallium monoselenide steeply decreases in the blue-violet spectral region regardless of the high structural quality of the surface [7]. A nanometric own oxide layer deposited in-between optical window electrode (In2O3) and the semiconductor results in the increase of the photosensitivity in the green-violet spectral region [8]. Multiple investigations carried out recently unambiguously demonstrate that the physical properties of the structures based on A III B VI stratified semiconductors are mostly determined by the type and characteristics of the optically transparent oxide [9, 10]. Zinc oxide, being polycrystalline, undoped and doped with low Al concentrations is a highly conductive material [7], and it is optically transparent in the visible spectral region [11]. ZnO has a certain amount of properties widely used in various devices (acoustic cells, varistor, gas sensors, etc. [12-17]). Nanocrystalline ZnO layers obtained by various technologies (spray pyrolysis, CBD, pulsed laser deposition, CVD, etc.) have a good adhesion to the surface of semiconductor or dielectric substrates. This fact is widely used in optoelectronic and solar energy conversion devices [15], photodetectors of UV radiation [16] and sources of laser radiation [17]. The characteristics of the devices based on ZnO and ZnO:Al are highly influenced by the properties of semiconductors used as a substrate.

The cellulosic materials were made oil resistant by chemical and topographic modifications, based on surface energy, surface roughness and barrier approaches. Detailed wetting studies of the prepared cellulosic materials were made using contact angle measurements and standardised penetration tests with different alkanes and oil mixtures. A significant part of the activities were devoted to the development of model cellulosic surfaces with different degrees of crystalline ordering for the wetting studies. Crystalline cellulose I, II and amorphous cellulose surfaces were prepared by spin-coating of cellulose nanocrystal or microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) dispersions, with Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) films or by a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition technique. The formation of multilayers consisting of polyethyleneimine (PEI)/anionic MFC or cationic MFC/anionic MFC was further studied and optimized in terms of total layer thickness and adsorbed amount by combining Dual Polarization Interferometry (DPI) or Stagnation Point Adsorption Reflectrometry (SPAR) with a Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D). The smooth cellulosic surfaces prepared had different molecular and mesostructure properties and different surface energies as shown by X-ray diffraction, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging, ellipsometry measurements and contact angle measurements. The cellulose model surfaces were found to be ideal for detailed wetting studies, and after the surface has been coated or covalently modified with various amounts of fluorosurfactants, the fluorinated cellulose films were used to follow the spreading mechanisms of different oil mixtures. The viscosity and surface tension of the oil mixtures, as well as the dispersive surface energy of the cellulose surfaces, were found to be essential parameters governing the spreading kinetics. A strong correlation was found between the surface concentration of fluorine, the dispersive surface energy and the measured contact angle of the oil mixtures. Silicon surfaces possessing structural porous characteristics were fabricated by a plasma etching process. The structured silicon surfaces were coated with sulfate-stabilized cellulose I nanocrystals using the LbL technique. These artificial intrinsically oleophilic cellulose surfaces were made highly oleophobic when coated with a thin layer of fluorinated silanes. By comparison with flat cellulose surfaces, which are oleophilic, it is demonstrated that the surface energy and the surface texture are essential factors preventing oil from spreading on the surface and, thus, inducing the observed macroscopic oleophobic properties. The use of the MFC for surface coating on base papers demonstrated very promising characteristics as packaging materials. Environmental-Scanning Electron Microscopy (E-SEM) micrographs indicated that the MFC layer reduced the sheet porosity, i.e. the dense structure formed by the nanofibers resulted in superior oil barrier properties. Attempts were made to link the procedure for preparation of the MFC dispersions to the resulting microstructure of the coatings, and film porosity and the film moisture content to the resulting permeability properties. Finally, MFC aerogels were successfully prepared by freeze-drying. The surface texture of the porous aerogels was carefully controlled by adjusting the concentration of the MFC dispersion used for the freeze-drying. The different scales of roughness of the MFC aerogels were utilised, together with the very low surface energy created by fluorination of the aerogel, to induce highly oleophobic properties.",abstracts of papers - american chemical society,['0065-7727'],journal,0,[],Aulin,,False,

Smink",Mott insulator,"In this report of a BSc assignment, investigations of properties of the materials LSCO (x=0.09) and NCCO (x=0.10) grown on an LSAT substrate with an STO capping are described. In particular, the electrical properties of these materials in p-n junctions and in an alternating multilayer are characterised.
The growth of a new multilayer sample of Mott insulators LSCO and NCCO is described and analysed. Techniques to grow thin films are introduced and discussed. For the growth pulsed laser deposition, photolithography, sputtering and Argon etching have been used. The sample quality has been determined using atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction and reflectivity and resistance measurements. This quality is concluded to be fair, certainly for a first ever attempt to grow such a sample.
The theory to analyse the results is presented, which includes Mott insulator physics, p-n junction theory, thin film characterisation, theory on superconductivity and antiferromagnetism. A parallel is made between semiconductor p-n junctions and superconducting p-n junctions.
The measurement methods, which include four-point measurements, lock-in measurements and IVT-measurements are discussed. The results are presented as IV-curves, IVT-diagrams and dV/dI curves to provide insight into p-n behaviour, transitions in the phase diagram and possible new effects arising from the properties of the sample.
The measurements done provided a large amount of information. For the single layer sample, p-n behaviour has been confirmed and material property transitions have been seen in the IVT-diagrams. Semiconductor-like pnp behaviour is confirmed as well, and the low bias resistance appears to be dominated by the first junction in the current path.
The multilayer sample displayed a wide variety of measurement results, despite only four junctions having been measured. Both ohmic and non-linear IV-curves have been observed at 300 K and superconductivity emerges in the LSCO at about 15-20 K. Indications for phase transitions have also been measured and provide clues for further research.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1570684796', 'https://openalex.org/W1617018551', 'https://openalex.org/W1964622047', 'https://openalex.org/W2005489991', 'https://openalex.org/W2011352105', 'https://openalex.org/W2056722718', 'https://openalex.org/W2137757776', 'https://openalex.org/W2144591886']",Bruijnes,,False,

Andersson, Per-Olof Holtz, Håkan Pettersson","Photocurrent, Indium arsenide","In this thesis, results are presented from the development of quantum dot (QD) based infrared photodetectors (IPs). This includes epitaxial growth of QDs, investigations of the structural, optical and electronic properties of the QD based material as well as characterisation of the resulting components. Metal organic vapour phase epitaxy is used for growth of selfassembled indium arsenide (lnAs) QDs on gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates. Through characterisation by atomic force microscopy, the correlation between size distribution and density of quantum dots and different growth parameters, such as temperature, InAs deposition time and V/III-ratio (ratio between group Vand group III species) is achieved. The V/111ratio is identified as the most important parameter, in finding the right growth conditions for QDs. A route towards optimisation of the dot size distribution through successive variations of the growth parameters is presented. The QD layers are inserted in Ino.15Gao.85As/GaAs quantum wells (QWs), forming so-called dots-in-a-well (DWELL) structures. These structures are used to fabricate IPs, primarily for detection in the long wavelength infrared region (LWIR, 8-12 µm). The electron energy level schemes of the DWELL structures are deduced by means of Fourier transform photoluminescence (FTPL) and FTPL excitation (FTPLE) measurements. Further characterisation of the IPs, through interband and intersubband photocurrent (pe) measurements as weIl as dark current measurements, is performed. By comparisons of the deduced energy level scheme of the DWELL structure and the results of the intersubband PC measurements, the origin of the PC is determined. The main intersubband transition contributing to the PC is identified as the QD ground state to the QW excited state transition. Significant variations of PC and dark current are observed, when voltage and temperature are used as variable parameters. A possible explanation to this could be the strong variation of the escape probability from different energy states in the DWELL structure, as revealed by interband PC measurements. These results are important for the further optimisation of the DWELL lP.",,,,0,[],Höglund,,False,

This thesis is attempting to overcome some of the challenges that hinder the implementation of CNTs in electronic packaging.
The first section concerns about the most essential issue in CNT application, the growth of CNTs. A new method is presented and it is capable of highly selective growth of CNTs, which is one of the main challenges in the CNT technology field. By growing CNTs on gold films using thermal chemical vapor deposition (TCVD) method, the number of CNT walls can be well controlled and statistical study shows that a selectivity of 79.4% can be achieved for double-walled CNTs.
The second section presents the design and fabrication of a CNT based on-chip cooler, attempting to utilize CNTs for heat dissipation from electronic systems. A test platform with integrated heating elements and temperature sensors is designed and fabricated for this purpose. A new CNT transfer technology is developed to transplant the CNT microfins with pre-defined structures to desired positions on the test platform. Electrical and mechanical characterizations demonstrate that the CNT-substrate interface has been dramatically improved after the transfer process therefore addressed two of the most challenging tasks on integrating CNTs into electronics, i.e. decreasing the huge interfacical contact resistance and improving the weak adhesion between CNTs and substrates. A double-coated single photoresist structure for thick materials deposition is also developed to facilitate and simplify the CNT transfer process. Multi-scale modeling is performed to help design the CNT microfin structure. A molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) is carred out to investigate the interaction between water and CNTs at the nanoscale and a finite element method (FEM) modeling is executed to analyze the fluid field and temperature distribution at the macroscale. A novel packaging process using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is also developed to assemble the CNT microfins, the test platform, the fluid channel and the supporting substrate into an integrated system. Cooling experiments have demonstrated the high efficiency of the CNT-based on-chip cooler.
The third section describes a novel concept to grow covalently bonded three dimensional CNT networks, which is potentially applicable to facilitate thermal transportation in micro systems. A nickel nitrate dissolved polymer is electrospun into inter-connected porous nano fiber networks acting as precursor. The polymer fibers are then burned out and nickel nitrate is decomposed at high temperature into nickel oxide fibers. These fibers are subsequently reduced into pure nickel in hydrogen environment. The as-reduced nickel nano fiber network serves as catalyst to grow graphite layers on their surfaces. Ultimately, the nickel core is etched by iron chloride so that graphite tubes, i.e. CNT structures are left. Since the nickel fibers are inter-connected with each other and graphite layers can only grow on the surface, the as-grown CNT network is covalently bonded. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) based bending tests show that the Young’s modulus of the as-grown CNTs is about 〖391〗_(-172)^(+270) GPa, and the covalently bonded CNT structure can effectively distribute external loading throughout the network to improve the mechanical strength of the material.",,,,0,[],Fu,,False,

A variety of shapes has been obtained using this technique including 'nanoscalpels' and 'nanoneedles' (see Figure 1). We performed detailed tests of the fabricated nanotools and found that, for example, nanoscalpels are hard enough for a single cut to penetrate a 45 nm thick gold layer; and thus can be used for making narrow electrode gaps required for fabrication of nanoelectronic devices or as a nanosurgical tool in cell biology [2]. The EBID fabricated nanoneedles have cylindrical shape with hemispherical apex and diameters in the range of 18-100nm. We found that they are resistant to breaking and recover elastically even after large deformations (i.e. vertical deformations up to 60% of the needle length) [3]. To explore the capabilities of these nanotools, corneocytes isolated from human skin, were indented. We found that nanoneedle probes can penetrate to large depths within cells and can be used for mechanical tomography of cells, e.g. to measure profiles of the variation with depth in intracellular elasticity and viscosity.

The samples were kept under vacuum except when transferring between apparatus or when making some of the measurements. No degradation of the Co wires was detected during the measurements. The mag- neto-optic response of the system was measured using x- ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Co L 2,3 edge and reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) at near-normal-incidence, which is sensitive to the normal component of the out-of-plane magnetization via the Kerr effect (MOKE). Capping the wires significantly impacts their magnetic properties. Comparison of the magneto- optic response of the system at x-ray and optical energies reveals small differences that are attributed to the in- duced moment in the Pt substrate and Au capping layer not picked up by the element specific XMCD measure- ments.. The sensitivity of RAS-MOKE is sufficient to al- low the determination of the easy axis direction of the capped wires to within a few degrees. The results for a 6- atom-wide Co wire sample, capped with 6 ML of Au, are consistent with the capped wires possessing perpendicu- lar magnetization. Copyright line will be provided by the publisher 1 Introduction Magnetic nanostructures exhibit novel physical phenomena not observed in bulk magnetic systems [1]. The magnetic properties of these low- dimensional systems often depend sensitively on both the morphology and symmetry of the nanostructures and the substrate on which they are grown [2]. Magnetic nanos- tructures must be protected from the environment if they are to have a technological application and this is often ac- complished by capping the structure with a thin non- magnetic layer. However, capping these structures with protective layers of non-magnetic material may modify their magnetic properties [3, 4], making the characteriza- tion of the buried interfacial region of such a capped struc- ture essential to understanding the underlying physics and materials science. Conventional surface techniques are in- sensitive to buried nanostructures, but a variety of x ray and optical techniques, with their larger penetration depth, can provide useful data. X-ray spectroscopies can give in- formation on shallow buried layers where their elemental sensitivity and, in the case of x-ray magnetic circular di- chroism (XMCD), their magnetic sensitivity [5], can pro- vide some of the desired information [6]. However, x-ray spectroscopies generally require synchrotron radiation sources for these experiments. In and around the visible region, special optical techniques (“epioptics”), using con- ventional broad band and laser sources, have been devel- oped that exploit the difference in the optical response of the interface and bulk. Epioptic techniques can be used to measure the optical response of buried nanostructures with sub-monolayer (ML) resolution [7]. Deposition of Co on clean Pt(997) between 250 K and 300 K, under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, results in the self-organized growth of periodic arrays of atomic wires along the upper edge of the monatomic steps of the (997) surface [8, 9]. The width of the terrace allows aligned wires from one to seven atoms wide to be grown by controlling the coverage, making it a very useful model system for probing magnetism in atomic scale nanowires.

Two types of devices were developed: an electrochemiluminescence device utilizing tunnel-emitted hot electrons, and a microhotplate semiconductor gas sensor with an atomic layer deposited (ALD) tin dioxide sensing film.
The hot electron-induced electrochemiluminescence (HECL) device is an integrated microelectrode device that combines an insulator-covered working electrode and a platinum counter electrode on a single chip. Two types of fluidic systems were integrated on the same type of electrode chip: either an enclosed sample chamber made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer, or hydrophobic sample confinement on the chip surface. Different metals were tested as the working electrode, and different types of insulator films made by various methods were tested as the tunneling dielectric, to determine the optimal working electrode structures for HECL. These were then used in the integrated microelectrode devices, which were fabricated on silicon and glass substrates. A variety of electrode geometries were tested with the different fluidic systems, and sub-nanomolar sensitivity and wide dynamic range were demonstrated with the best devices. Ongoing work with polymeric substrates is briefly presented.
In the review, latest results are presented on the restoration of the hydrophilic properties of enclosed PDMS microfluidic channels. While a PDMS surface quickly reverts to its naturally hydrophobic state, thus preventing capillary filling, this plasma treatment enables capillary filling even after extended periods of storage.
The gas sensor is a microhotplate (MHP) device, utilizing a tin dioxide sensing layer deposited by ALD for the first time in a MHP sensor. Unconventional solutions were developed for the fabrication sequence to accommodate the demands of the deposition method. Also, metallizations and intermetal dielectrics not commonly used in MHP devices were tested to enable rapid processing of prototype devices with available methods and equipment.

Audouard",Surface phonon,"Ultrafast laser radiation has a strong potential for surface structuring on ultimate scales due to a strongly localized character of energy deposition. Additionally, the appearance of periodic surface patterns with subwavelength dimensions, usually known as laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS), is an inherent and quasi-universal phenomenon, onsetting for fluences around the phase transformation threshold. Depending on laser parameters and material properties, these self-formed structures develop with varying periodicity and amplitudes. We propose here a study concerning the effect of energy coupling on LIPSS formation. We generated LIPSS on various materials with different electronic configuration in order to investigate the influence of the electron-phonon coupling strength and thermal diffusion efficiency on the specific contrast of LIPSS. Representative metals (simple, transition, noble) with a large range of coupling strengths were exposed to ultrafast laser excitation and the patterning surface was investigated ex-situ by atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The relative strength and the electron temperature dependence of the electron-phonon coupling in the metals are identified as key factors affecting the initial energy redistribution and the dimensional size of the region undergoing transient melting and resolidification. It appears that growth of the contrast and increase of the ripples height are correlated to the evolution of the constant of coupling and to the amount of material experiencing solid-to-liquid transitions. Additionally, in order to be able to control the interaction process and the subsequent pattern resulting from relaxation and organisation processes, a thorough understanding of excitation, melting and solidification mechanism is required. We propose hydrodynamic simulation of laser-matter interaction to calculate laser energy deposition, electron-ion nonequilibrium stage and material heating [1]. Time history of ripples formation and growth is discussed in this context of matter transformation phases using a capillarity approach. The combined models account for fast variations in optical properties and electron-phonon coupling which may transiently change the coupling conditions of the target material, influencing in turn the width of the thermally affected layer thickness. Apart from the comprehension effort related to laser excitation mechanisms, the objective is to assist and validate experiments allowing to design matter transformation scales and patterns in designing user-defined matter transformations with predictable properties for a wide range of metals by taking advantage of their behavior under nonequilibrium conditions. To this end and, in the context of present requirements of high precision patterning of materials, this presentation indicates as well an application related to laser-induced marking, authentification and traceability of applications products. This is based on the optical response of subwavelength structures and the possibility to color code. Due to the ripples periodicity in the range of visible spectrum, a complex colorization process of the material has been performed to impress defined information colors on the surface [2]. This process based on the control of the laser-driven nanostructure orientation allows gathering variable information in a minimal surface, providing a high efficient way to perform identifying codes.",,,,0,[],Colombier,,False,

Nevertheless, controlling and tailoring the size and distribution of these nanodotes for possible devices is a challenge and requires a thorough knowledge of the complex interaction between atoms and surface. Since cobalt is regarded as one of the most important elements used in magnetic materials for magnetic or magneto-optical devices and silicon is the key element used in the semiconductor industry, the combination of these two materials will promote the development of materials and devices for next-century magnetoelectronics. However, it is known that Co reacts easily with Si even at room temperature [1]. Nevertheless, recent works have shown that a buffer layer still strongly affects the surface diffusion of deposited atoms and the subsequent island nucleation [2-5]. Annealing of monolayer (ML) amounts of Cu on Si(111) leads to an (5.55×5.55) periodic reconstruction with excellent thermal stability. Although the Cu/Si(111) layer does not exhibit a true long range periodicity, its good stability, together with the significant removal of the Si dangling bonds, indicates that it is a good template for the fabrication of self-assembled Co nanoclusters. As far as we know, there are few studies of Co/Cu/Si(111) system. The present study provides the structural property of self-assembled Co nanoclusters on Cu/Si(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). STM and LEED results show that the Co nanolusters changes not only in the island size but also in the island shape and structures on the top of the islands with increasing substrate temperature from room temperature to 830K during deposition. It was confirmed that the ultrathin buffer layer on Si (111) surface has a significant influence on the surface morphology after subsequent depostiong of Co. On one hand it can partly prevent Co to form Co silicide. On the other hand the diffusion of Co atoms on the surface can be greatly enhanced.

Recent relevant examples span from layered heteroepitaxial systems exhibiting ionic conductivity [1], vertically assembled multifunctional nanostructures [2, 3] to superconducting nanocomposite films [4]. Therefore, the atomic-scale study of interfaces and the investigation of the strain state of thin films and nanostructures are crucial in exploring the structure-function correlations.
 The challenge of studying the microstructure at the interface between two materials is typically addressed by electron microscopy. Direct exploration of interfaces is possible in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) by means of cross-sectional investigations. The improved experimental resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in images due to advances on spherical aberration correction enables more accurate image interpretation at subnanometer scale resolution. As an example, the spherical aberration corrected microscope at CEMES, Toulouse, used in this thesis, allows to measure deformations at the nanoscale by the geometrical phase analysis (GPA) technique [5] from high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images to an accuracy of less than 1pm [6, 7]. Structural information at a larger scale and local chemical information may also be gained in the TEM using different imaging modes and various spectroscopies.
 The microstructure of the systems under study is strongly dependent on the deposition process employed and on the particular processing conditions. While only one chapter of this report deals with high-temperature superconductors (HTS), the choice of the deposition process used for the growth of all the different films and nanostructured templates reported here comes from previous research performed on deposition methods for HTS wire technology. In other words, the synthesis of the samples studied for completion of this work has strongly benefited from the advances for the development of epitaxially deposited YBa2Cu3O7 superconducting films and associated buffer layers during the last years [8, 9]. Epitaxial thin films and lower dimension structures explored in this thesis were grown by metal-organic decomposition (MOD), being capable of homogeneously covering large areas of material with relatively low cost. Thus, results obtained with this technique gather high potential to be ultimately used in power industry [10]. However, despite this added value, there are few specialists focused on the study of the microstructure of solution-derived systems.
 For this thesis, a variety of nanostructured functional oxide systems grown by colleagues of this research group by MOD have been investigated using TEM. This work is aimed to investigate the microstructural mechanisms acting at interfaces between multiple solution-derived materials and their strain state. A further goal is to investigate the dependence of the microstructure on processing conditions and the correlation between microstructure and specific properties of the different nanostructured systems. A motivation for this thesis was that the exploration of the microstructure of various solution-derived nanostructured systems and their evolution under specific processing conditions may lead to advances on the preparation of novel functional materials based on interface control. The materials explored during this thesis and reported in the experimental part of this manuscript are: superconducting YBa2Cu3O7 thin films grown on a BaZrO3 nanodot templates on (001) LaAlO3 substrates, different self-nanostructured La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films grown on (001) SrTiO3, and self-assembled La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 nanodots on (001) MgO substrates. These systems display a strain state and interface structure which is observed to strongly affect their performance. Particularly, differences in the superconducting properties for the case of the nanostructured YBa2Cu3O7 thin films and on the magnetotransport properties for the case of segregated La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films and nanodots are observed to be correlated to microstructure. The present thesis reviews the investigation performed on these systems.

Burrows, Ryan Cash, Barry Fell, Julian McKenzie, L. B. Jones, H. E. Scheibler, Keith Middleman, A. S. Terekhov",Photocathode,"Accelerators and Lasers In Combined Experiments (ALICE) is an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) built at STFC Daresbury Laboratory to investigate the process of energy recovery [1]. The project is an accelerator research facility intended to develop the technology and expertise required to build new light sources in the UK based on of Free-Electron Lasers. The original design of the ALICE photoinjector derives from the Jefferson Laboratory IRFEL photocathode gun. In its current configuration, the ALICE gun accommodates only a single photocathode, and the system must be vented to atmospheric pressure to facilitate photocathode replacement. To meet the stringent vacuum demands for good photocathode lifetime, the system then requires baking for up to three weeks. A new load-lock photocathode preparation facility (PPF) has been designed as part of an upgrade to the ALICE photoinjector. The PPF can accommodate up to six photocathodes, and permits rapid transfer of photocathodes between the PPF activation chamber and the ALICE gun, thus maintaining the integrity of the photoinjector vacuum system. The PPF was successfully commissioned with a GaAs photocathode in spring 2009, and has since permitted a quantum yield of 15 % to be achieved at a wavelength of 635 nm. Presently, a new photoinjector gun vessel and photocathode transport system is under design/manufacture, with a view to this being fully-installed on ALICE in spring 2011. ALICE PHOTOINJECTOR UPGRADE The whole ALICE photoinjector upgrade program includes: the development of photocathodes capable of delivering of 10-100 mA CW current; an integrated gun and PPF with a transfer system allowing for replacement of the photocathode in the gun within few hours; and a new gun vessel with improved pumping capabilities [2]. The current ALICE photocathode is a 25 mm O GaAs wafer activated in-situ and illuminated over a 4 mm O area by a 532 nm laser to drive electron emission [3]. The new photocathode assembly has been designed to accommodate a semiconductor heterostructure (1) with a 9.5 mm O active area, as shown in Fig. 1. As the laser only illuminates an area ~ 4 mm O, use of a smaller active area could help reduce the beam halo. The photocathode wafer is bound to 1.4 mm recess on the bottom of upturned 2 mm thick molybdenum “Petri dish” (2) with a diameter of 19 mm and a height of 6.5 mm. The polished surface of the cup (3) improves heat flow away from the photocathode surface when a high power laser is used to drive emission of high beam currents. The photocathode is retained in a transport holder (4) by a flat inconel spring (5). During preparation and operation, the photocathode is installed into a socket (6). Figure 1. GaAs photocathode in the mounting socket. The design of the three-chamber extreme-high vacuum PPF has been described in detail [4]. It comprises a loading chamber (LC), an atomic hydrogen cleaning chamber (HCC) and a preparation chamber (PC) (Fig. 2). Photocathodes are transferred between the chambers and also from the PPF into the photoinjector gun using magnetically-coupled linear manipulators. The proposed upgrade scheme permits usage of a variety of III-V photocathodes which may be activated with the PPF. The upgrade design will allow for the easy replacement of the III-V PPF with a facility for preparation or transport of a different type of photocathodes without venting the gun. One of the possible options under consideration is usage of ultra fast alkali antimonide-based photocathodes, which may operate at a wavelength of 532 nm with reasonably high levels of quantum efficiency. ___________________________________________ _____________ *boris.militsyn@stfc.ac.uk Proceedings of IPAC’10, Kyoto, Japan TUPE095 02 Synchrotron Light Sources and FELs A16 Energy Recovery Linacs 2347 Embodiment of the ALICE photoinjector upgrade is currently underway. The PPF has been constructed and commissioned in ‘stand-alone’ mode using GaAs heterostructures. A sophisticated side-load photocathode transport mechanism has been designed, and will be tested first in atmosphere, then in an extra-high vacuum facility which duplicates the vacuum conditions of the real gun. The test facility is now being commissioned. OPERATION OF THE III-V PPF IN STAND-ALONE COMMISIONING MODE In order to commission and to optimize our photocathode preparation procedure, the PPF has been operating in stand-alone mode. The vacuum port which will connect the PPF to the gun via an all-metal gate valve has been connected to a turbo vacuum pump which is used during the bake-out procedure. This solution will permit connection of the PPF to the operational gun without its ventilation. Originally, the III-V photocathode family (such as GaAs, GaAsP, InGaAsP, as grown) have a Positive Electron Affinity (PEA), which for GaAs is 4 eV. In order to make GaAs photocathodes able to emit electrons when illuminated by 532 nm light typical for ERL DC guns, the electron affinity should be lowered to less than 1 eV or even brought to a negative value. This process requires deposition on the atomically-clean photocathode surface of alternating thin layers of Cs and an oxidant, typically O2 or NF3, and is called activation. In the vacuum laboratory where the PPF is installed, O2 oxidant is used. Figure 2. III-V Photocathode Preparation Facility in the ASTeC vacuum laboratory. 1 – Loading Chamber (LC), 2 Atomic Hydrogen Cleaning Chamber (HCC), 3Preparation Chamber (PC), 4 magnetic manipulator, 5 hydrogen cylinder, 6 oxygen piezo-electric leak valve, 7 control rack An ideal photocathode preparation procedure includes chemical etching of the photocathode surface in hydrochloric acid to remove As and Ga oxides in a dedicated glove box under a pure nitrogen atmosphere. The photocathode is then transferred to the LC via a nitrogenfilled transport vessel to prevent the formation of new oxide species (see Fig. 2). The transport vessel can accommodate up to four samples simultaneously, though the full glove box procedure has not yet been implemented, so photocathodes are placed into the transport vessel as delivered rather than etched. The LC pumping system includes an oil-free preliminary pumping station, backed by an ion pump. During loading, the LC is vented to dry nitrogen gas. It is then pumped down to a typical pressure of 10 mbar, and then subjected to a short bake at a temperature of 120150 C in order to remove water from the samples. Once acceptable vacuum in the LC is established, the photocathode is transferred to the HCC for exposure to atomic hydrogen. Although it was originally implemented for rejuvenation of spent photocathodes, atomic hydrogen cleaning is now used for initial photocathode cleaning.

Arenholz 3 Diamond Light Source, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 0DE, United Kingdom Department of Materials Science and Engineering, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720 (Dated: June 22, 2010) We show that the angular dependence of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) is strongly sensitive to strain induced electronic structure changes in magnetic transition metal oxides. We observe a pronounced dependence of the XMCD spectral shape on the experimental geometry as well as non-vanishing XMCD with distinct spectral features in transverse geometry in compressively strained MnCr 2 O 4 ﬁlms. The XMCD can be described as a linear combination of an isotropic and an angular dependent anisotropic contribution, the latter linearly proportional to the axial distortion due to strain. The XMCD spectra are well reproduced by atomic multiplet calculations. PACS numbers: 68.60.Bs, 78.70.Dm, 78.20.Bh, 75.50.Gg The delicate balance between charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides leads to unique phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance [1], high temperature superconductivity, [2] as well as a remarkable diversity of charge, spin, and orbital or- dered phases. The rich phase diagrams are determined by the strong local interaction of electrons in transition metal d orbitals [3]. Subtle changes in d occupancy and overlap—and thereby phase transitions—can be induced by variations in temperature, by external ﬁelds, through doping, and lattice distortions. Especially the strong coupling of the electronic properties with structural pa- rameters allows controlling the physical characteristics of nanoarchitectures through strain at interfaces of layered and nanocomposite heterostructures [4–8]. Here we show that the angular dependence of the x-ray magnetic cir- cular dichroism (XMCD) signal provides unique insights into the impact of strain on the electronic structure of magnetic transition metal oxides. For an isotropic system, magnetically saturated by an external ﬁeld, the XMCD signal scales with the angle, θ, between the ﬁeld and x-ray beam as cos θ. [9] Con- sequently, in transverse geometry, i.e., perpendicular ori- entation of x rays and ﬁeld (θ = 90 ◦ ), the XMCD sig- nal vanishes completely. In systems with cubic magnetic anisotropy the XMCD spectrum is slightly diﬀerent along ⟨001⟩ and ⟨111⟩ directions [10]. The angular dependence of the intensity of the XMCD spectral features can be well described by the lowest order term for the cubic anisotropy [10], however, the XMCD signal still disap- pears for θ = 90 ◦ . This is no longer the case for systems with axial magnetic anisotropy, such as uniaxial, tetrag- onal, or trigonal symmetry of the lattice. In this case a non-vanishing integral of the XMCD signal indicates a non-zero component of the orbital magnetic moment perpendicular to the spin moment, a situation encoun- tered in, e.g., thin ﬁlms with strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Whereas changes in the integrated intensity, proportional to the orbital moment, have been observed [11, 12], less attention has been paid to the detailed spec- tral shape of the XMCD and its correlation with struc- tural distortions. Here we determine the strain induced electronic struc- ture changes in ferrimagnetic spinel MnCr 2 O 4 ﬁlms. The system does not exhibit any cubic magnetic anisotropy in slightly compressively strained ﬁlms allowing us to unambiguously isolate the impact of an axial distorted cubic symmetry on the XMCD signal. We observe a pronounced angular dependence of the Mn 2+ and Cr 3+ L 3,2 XMCD as well as non-vanishing XMCD signals with distinct spectral features in transverse geometry. The experimental results are well reproduced using atomic multiplet calculations taking into account the reduced symmetry of the crystal lattice induced by the strain. This method holds promising perspectives for studying the electronic structure of magnetic oxide thin ﬁlms. MnCr 2 O 4 epitaxial thin ﬁlms were synthesized by pulsed laser deposition using stoichiometric single-phase targets at an energy density of 1-1.5 J/cm 2 on Nb-doped SrTiO 3 (001) substrates held at 900 K. The samples were annealed in air for 9 h at 1100 K after deposition. While the theoretical lattice mismatch between MnCr 2 O 4 and Nb-doped SrTiO 3 is 6.5%, x ray diﬀraction (XRD) mea- surements on the 55 nm thick MnCr 2 O 4 ﬁlms reveal a compressive strain of ∼0.9% indicating that the chosen ﬁlm thickness and the post-growth annealing result in a partial relaxation of the strain. At a sample temperature of 20 K the Mn and Cr magnetic moments are collinear [13] and can be aligned in arbitrary directions by external ﬁelds below 0.5 T [see upper inset in Fig. 1(a)]. There is no indication of signiﬁcant cubic magnetic anisotropy in the ﬁlms. The XMCD signal was determined by inde- pendently varying the angle γ of the incident x-rays and angle µ of the magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the sample normal using an eight-pole electromagnet [14].

In particular, nanotechnology aims to control the growth and chatraclterization of materials at the atomic scale. To be able to control processes at such slzales, rather sophisticated experimental set-ups are required, designed to monitor processes occurring on a size scale where the atomic and quantum nature of matter becomes unavoidable. This means that the techniques used to grow and study these istructures become the link for understanding them. This also implies that nanoscience will only progress as far as the available techniques are capable of probing properties at the nanoscale always with increasing precision.
For a semiconductor m'aterial the restriction in size to the nanoscale will affect the motion of electrons, resulting in quantized states of their kinetic energy. In one- dimensional nanostructures such as nanowires, the movement of the electrons is limited to this single dimension. These properties will affect the electronic characteristics of the semiconductor nanostructures and have the potential to be used to design electrical and optical devices in the nanoscale tuning their optoelectronical properties to best suit our needs.
Semiconductor nanowires have promising applications in nano-electronics, nanophotonic devices and integrated nanosystems. Zinc oxide nanowires have high piezoelectric constant (dg; = 246) which makes them good candidates for micro and nano-mechanical devices such as acoustic transducers, sensors and actuators which can successfully be synthesized by the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process. One- dimensional gallium nitride nanowires synthesized by the hydride vapor epitaxy can be used for visible optoelectronics components since they are characterized by a wide band gap of 3.4 eV. Calcium hexaboride nanowires synthesized by the thermal process have low density (2.45 g/cm3), high melting point (2235°C), and high hardness T (260Okg/mm2) and high Young's modulus (379 GPa) making them an ideal high temperature material in aerospace applications. Heterostructured gallium phosphide-gallium arsenide nanowires grown by the VaporLiquid?~So|id (VLS) mechanism can be used as field effect transistors, logic gates, and super current switches because the electronic properties can easily be tuned by controllingthe chemical composition and dopant concentrations.
ln order to obtain nanowires with different suitable crystalline structures and optoelectronical properties, the proper growth methods need to be used. Many techniques have been developed for the synthesis and formation of one-dimensional nanostructured materials. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is one of the most commonly used methods to synthesize nanowires. ln the CVD method, the precursor gas is delivered tothe surface of the substrate, where the synthesis occurs under catalytic conditions. In the last decade, the use of gold as nucleation and growth seed has been the most successful method for the nanowire synthesis process. The main problem with this technique is that gold is a fast-diffusing metal which therefore degrades their semiconducting properties. In the past years, this problem has been solved by using. different metals as catalysts or by avoiding the very same use of catalysts.
Recently, growth without an external catalyst heels been demonstrated both by using Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). The MBE is particularly interesting since it offers the possibility of the growth of high purity materials with excellent crystal quality and versatility of growth modes of one and two dimensional nanostructures. This technique can be used to add complexity to the nanowires structures. As an illustration, let us recall that more complex structures have been obtained by combining materials coaxially and axially I along the growth direction of the nanowires. Coaxial heterostructures have been considered to improve the performance of nanowire devices to confine the carriers at the core, leading to the reduction of surface scattering. Using these techniques one can also obtain heterostructures formed by the same material in the two crystalline phases, zinc blende and wurtzite. 
In this thesis the morphology, crystal structure and associated physical A properties of various types of one-dimensional nanostructures have been studied in detail by high resolution transmission electron micrpscopy (HRTEM) and related techniques. We will present results from studies of semiconductors nanowires composed by group IV type .e|ements, in particular Si nanowires, as well as III-V compounds, such as GaAs and PGaN.
The outline of this thesis is as follows: first of all in Chapter 1 we discuss the J motivation for research in Semiconductor nanowires, the synthesis methods used to grow the various types of$ nanowire samples that will be analyzed and the characterization techniques that have been used for the studies presented in this thesis, with emphasis on transinission electron microscopy methods.
The core of this thesis then follows, divided into two main parts depending on the type of materiallthat composes the nanowires: group IV materials and group III-V materials. 
The first part of_this thesis corresponds to a detailed study of the structural properties of semiconductor Si nanowires. ln Chapter 2, we discuss a precise structural characterization of Gallium assisted Si nanowires, which includes a thorough classification of the different types of twin defects that appear in these nanowires and a detailed comparison withi related studies in the literature for Si nanowires synthesized with other catalyst metals.
Then in Chapter 3 we present a quantitative analysis of variations in structure in Si nanowires from HRTEM images by means of the Geometric Phase Analysis (GPA).
This study allows a deeper understanding of the crystalline structures which are found in the studied nanowires, since HRTEM images per se can sometimes lead to rather misleading interpretations. ini particular, we will show that a region in a given Si nanowire that naively can be iinterpreted as 9R polytype structure is in fact explained by twin overlapping. 
The second part of thisj thesis is the study of structural properties of group IIIV nanowires. In Chapter 4, weganalyze the structural properties of GaAs nanowires formed by heterostructures composed by the same material in two different crystalline phases, Zinc Blende (ZB) and Wurtzite (W). We study the crystalline structure of several samples of GaAs nanowires grown under different As4 pressures.
We study the correlation between the average structural and optical properties of these nanowires and suggest ai model for the nanowire bandgap structure. In order to validate in detail this model, we perform a direct correlation analysis between structural properties and photoluminescence spectra on a one-by-one nanowire basis.
 We also present a statistical analysis of the distributionilof wurtzite segment thickness in order to connect with theoretical models of twin grovvth and formation.
In the second section devoted to group lIl-\(,g nanowires we have studied.
heterostructures which are formed by the combination of two different materials. Two cases have been considered, first coaxial and then axial heterostructures. Coaxial heterostructures of the type AlAs/GaAs/A|As grown on; the facets of GaAs nanowires and giving place to prismatic quantum wells (p-QW) are discussed in Chapter 5. We show how to characterize the deposition of layers on the facets of nanowires by means of HRTENI and related techniques, which in turn are used to validate the theoretical model for this growth. As we will see, the use of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) electron tomography allows performing a 3D reconstruction of the prismatic heterostructures, leading to a deeper understanding of the growth mechanisms.
Finally, in Chapter 6 we study the structural andioptical properties of GaN/AIN axial multi quantum well (MQW) nanowires by means of HRTEl\/l. ln addition, the determination of the presence of strain in the interface between the two materials is important since strain is known to affect the electronic properties of the nanowire.
Therefore HRTEl\/l in combination with the image processing technique of geometrical phase analysis (GPA) are employed in order to investigate the two dimensional strain distribution.",,,,0,[],Conesa-Boj,,False,
2074,2126,https://openalex.org/W40895312,,bonding mechanism of cold sprayed al and al-al2o3 composite coatings on mg alloy,article,2012-01-01,2012,,,,,Qiang Wang,Conversion coating,"The high strength-to-weight ratio of Mg alloys has attracted increasing interest in transportation industry for the purpose of vehicle weight reduction in order to improve the fuel efficiency. However, applications of Mg alloys have been significantly limited by the poor wear and corrosion resistance. Surface treatment has been recognized as one of the most effective approaches to overcoming these disadvantages, which can provide Mg alloys with sufficient protection without altering the bulk microstructure and properties.As an emerging technology featured with low temperate operation, cold spray (CS) continues to attract increasing attention in the area of surface engineering. The popularity of CS is also attributed to its simplicity that only high pressure gas is used to accelerate metal or metal and ceramic mixed powders towards the target. The formation of coatings is under a completely solid state, which can minimize the effect of heating defects, such as oxidation, phase transformation, and porosity induced by fast cooling of the melt associated with conventional thermal spray. Therefore, CS is particularly suitable for metals with low melting temperatures, such as Mg and Al. However, although cold spray has been developed and studied for more than 30 years, the actual bonding mechanisms between the particles within the cold sprayed coating and between the coating and the substrate are still not completely understood. The aim of the present PhD thesis was to investigate and comprehensively understand such bonding mechanisms with focus on pure Al and Al-based Al2O3 reinforced composite coatings because it has been verified that such coatings can effectively improve the wear and corrosion resistance of Mg alloys.Starting with optimization of the cold spray parameters to obtain dense and highly bonded Al coatings on AZ91 Mg alloy substrate, the in-flight particle velocity and temperature were calculated based on the gas-particle flow model. Combining with the experimental observations, a critical velocity of ~520 m/s was determined for successful deposition. Increasing gas temperature and pressure raises the particle velocity and thus improves the quality of coatings. Relationship between particle velocities and coating properties was identified. The effect of Al2O3 particles on the coating microstructure, hardness, deposition efficiency, and bond strength was also studied. Experimental results show that addition of Al2O3 particles not only significantly improves the density of the coating, but also enhances the bonding strength. Higher Al2O3 content resulted in a failure mode transition from adhesive to cohesive.The interfacial structure between particle and particle within the cold sprayed coating and between particle and substrate was studied in more details in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Severe plastic deformation takes place on the surfaces of particles within the coating, leading to the occurrence of adiabatic shear instability (ASI), which not only prompts grain refinement at localized areas along the particle boundaries, but also enables formation of intimate bonding between particles through materials inter-penetration and self-diffusion. In contrast, the interior of particles experiences less deformation. In addition, high resolution TEM examination verifies the intimate atomic bond formed along the interface of particle/substrate. The high speed impact of Al particle on Mg alloy substrate results in severe plastic deformation on the surface layers of both the particle and substrate at different extents during cold spray. Within the central region of the particle/substrate interface, compressive strain dominates the plastic deformation, which leads to both the grain refinement and formation of intimate interfacial bond between the particle and the substrate. Within the peripheral region of the particle/substrate contact area, an intermixing zone associated with some amorphous features forms as results of lattice disruption and temperature elevation through adiabatic shear instability, trigged by the shear plastic deformation at high strain rate. EBSD analysis indicates that there are no preferred crystal orientations within cold sprayed Al coating. However, the normal plane and the cross plane of the cold sprayed coatings show anisotropic nanomechanics. Higher nanohardness, larger reduced elastic modulus and lower friction coefficient are experimentally observed on the cross plane than those on the normal plane. This is attributed to the higher density of particle boundaries on the cross plane.In order to further improve the bond strength between cold sprayed Al coatings and Mg alloy substrate, post-spray annealing treatment was carried out at various temperatures and time. Based on the different reaction behaviour between coatings and substrates, diffusion couples of cold sprayed Ni on Cu and Cu on Cu were included as comparative cases. Formation of intermetallic compounds in the Al/Mg system dramatically reduced bonding strength. In Cu/Cu and Ni-Cu, diffusion bonds developed at lower temperatures as Ni-Cu forms an isomorphous system, effectively increasing bonding strength. However, higher temperature annealing ultimately reduced bonding strength due to Kirkendall pores. In addition, a comprehensive understanding of advantages using cold spray was provided by conducting a comparative study with detonation thermal spray in producing Al based composite coatings on Mg alloy substrate. Because of the solid consolidation, lower porosity was achieved in cold sprayed coatings, which leads to a better corrosion resistance.",,,,0,[],Wang,,False,

The degree of enhancement is strongly de- pendent on the lattice distortions imposed on the SrRuO 3 ﬁlms by SrTiO 3 , (LaAlO 3 ) 0.3 (SrTaO 3 ) 0.7 (LSAT), and LaAlO 3 substrates. A larger enhancement of magnetization for coherently strained SrRuO 3 ﬁlms on SrTiO 3 and LSAT compared to fully relaxed ﬁlms on LaAlO 3 conﬁrms the im- portance of the strain state in determining the magnetic ground state of the Ru ion. In particular, SrRuO 3 ﬁlms on (111) SrTiO 3 exhibit exhanced moments as high as 3.8 µ B /Ru ion, thus suggesting the stabilization of a high-spin Ru 4+ state. Transition metal complex oxides comprise a fundamen- tally intriguing and technonologically promising family of materials with a wide range of properties. The tunability of these properties via lattice distortions has been stud- ied in detail in bulk and thin ﬁlm form. While in the past it has often been diﬃcult to separate out the eﬀects of microstructure and defects from those of strain in epitax- ial ﬁlms, recent advances in atomically precise complex oxide thin ﬁlm deposition techniques make it possible. Among the transition metal oxides, SrRuO 3 (SRO) is unique in that it is a 4d transition metal oxide that ex- hibits ferromagnetism and metallic conductivity. It has a distorted perovskite structure with a pseudocubic lat- tice parameter of 3.93 ˚ .[1, 2] Bulk SrRuO 3 exhibits A Curie temperature (T C ) ≈ 160 K and a moment of 1.1- 1.6 µ B per Ru 4+ ion.[1, 3–5] These values are signiﬁ- cantly reduced from the low-spin conﬁguration value of 2 µ B /Ru 4+ ion. The reduction has been attributed to the delocalization of spin in an itinerant ferromagnet. SRO has also been identiﬁed as a technologically promising material as it has been incorporated both as an electrode in oxide devices and a structural template for other oxide ﬁlms.[6–9] Recently, layer-by-layer growth of SrRuO 3 thin ﬁlms has enabled the growth of near perfect epitaxial thin ﬁlms.[10, 11] However, the majority of this work exam- ines ﬁlms grown on (001) SrTiO 3 substrates. There has been some theoretical work that has predicted supressed magnetization for (i) SRO ﬁlms under compressive epi- taxial strain and (ii) SRO ﬁlms compressed on the (110) plane in comparison with (001) SRO ﬁlms.[12] Exper- imentally, remarkably little is known about the eﬀects of the magnitude and symmetry of lattice distortions on the magnetization.[13, 14] Epitaxial growth of SRO ﬁlms provides model systems to study these distortions and their eﬀects on magnetism. In this paper we demonstrate that magnetization can be enhanced in SRO ﬁlms through lattice distortions gen- erated by epitaxial strain. By modifying substrate choice and orientation as well as ﬁlm thickness, we have system- atically varied the magnitude and symmetry of the lattice distortions in SRO ﬁlms imposed by the substrate. We ﬁnd magnetization enhanced from bulk values that are consistent with the presence of the maximum spin mo- ment of 2 µ B for low spin Ru 4+ ions and a small orbital moment contribution in (001) and (110) SRO ﬁlms. How- ever, the high moment enhancement of (111) SRO ﬁlms cannot be explained by a low-spin picture of the Ru 4 + ion, even in the case of perfect alignment of both spin and orbital contributions, thus suggesting the stabilization of a high-spin Ru state. Epitaxial SRO thin ﬁlms were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on (001), (110), and (111) SrTiO 3 (STO) as well as (001) LaAlO 3 (LAO), and (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O 3 (LSAT) substrates. Each substrate places the overlying SRO ﬁlm under compressive strain with epi- taxial strain mismatch ranging from 0.64% in STO and 1.53% in LSAT to 3.56% in LAO. All ﬁlms were grown at 700 ◦ C in 60 mtorr of O 2 with a laser ﬂuence of 1.29 J/cm 2 . To minimize oxygen vacancies, samples were post-annealed at 600 ◦ C for 7 minutes and cooled in at- mospheric pressure O 2 . Film thicknesses range from 20 to 120 nm. In this paper, we will describe the orien- tation of the SRO in terms of the pseudocubic lattices parameters a bulk = b bulk = c bulk = 3.93 ˚ .[15, 16] These A lattice parameters are rotated 45 ◦ from the orthorhom- bic, nearly cubic lattice parameters a bulk = 5.57 ˚ , b bulk A = 5.53 ˚ and c bulk ≈ 7.84 ˚ . A A All SrRuO 3 ﬁlms exhibited good epitaxy, as indicated by the X-Ray Diﬀraction (XRD) spectra that showed only SrRuO 3 ﬁlm peaks with the same orientation as the underlying substrates.

Due to the self-assembly characteristic of quantum dots, firstly, we have employed Lithography and Etching process to fabricate patterned silicon substrate with periodic array structure on it. Then applied Chemical Vapor Deposition process, the growth of germanium quantum dots on patterned silicon substrate would be achieved by utilizing the characteristic of Lattice mismatch,. We have successfully demonstrated well-aligned Ge dots with uniform size distribution on Si (001) grown on one-dimension grating array structure and two-dimension hole array structure respectively. During the production of Ge QDs, we found that the originally designed nanoscale pit revealed morphological evolution after in-situ heat treatment. Recently, many literatures have indicated that the growth of Ge QDs on pattered substrate will be significantly dominated by the morphology of nanoscale pit. Because of the existing Chemical Potential between the silicon-germanium interface, which affect the positioning and formation of Ge QDs. Furthermore, the chemical potential is a function of Curvature, and the curvature is determined by the surface morphology of nanoscale pit. Therefore, the study of nanoscale pit morphological evolution during heat treatment has a fundamental and significant meaning. It might provide us a detailed and thorough understanding in Ge QDs research field. This thesis is mainly focused on discussing the morphological evolution of nanoscale pit during ultra-high vacuum heat treatment and defines each characteristic of the evolution results. In addition, we would like to discuss the mechanism which leads to the morphological evolution. First, we processed heat treatment on the sample at different pressure and temperature. We measured the surface morphology of nanoscale pit by tapping-type atomic force microscope (AFM) and found that only in low pressure and high temperature environment, the morphological evolution of nanoscale pit would be observed. Then, we observe the morphological evolution of nanoscale pit during different time in low pressure and high temperature condition. The important characteristics of the morphological evolution results as the following, the depth decreased, the ridge width narrowed, the sidewall angle became smaller, the bottom distance decreased. In the same time, an extremely interesting result is observed. That is, the origin designed patterns (using E-beam lithography and RIE) of nanoscale pits are circle and square (both top and bottom) respectively, however; after long time heat treatment, the bottom shape of each pits turned to square and the sidewall was formed as four facets. In order to observe more details of the morphological evolution, we fabricated a series of nanoscale pits with different sizes. The experiment results reveals that both circle and square nanoscale pit remain their original morphology before heat treatment, as the heating time increased, the morphology began to change. We found in the middle step of the change, the transient morphology of the nanoscale pits (circle and square) are multi-line shapes (irregular polygon). However, in the final step, they will both become to square bottom shape and four-facet sidewall. All those changes have no regard with the pit size. Furthermore, we draw the 3D structure diagram for easier understand the whole surface morphology of the pit. This kind of morphology (square bottom shape and four-facet sidewall) is defined as truncated inverted-pyramid. It significant characteristics as follows, the four sides of the square bottom are along with and the four facets of the sidewall are . Taking 200nm a circle pit for example, after long time heat treatment, the morphology became to truncated inverted-pyramid. And the pit depth decreased from the original 58nm to the final 20nm, ridge width decreased from the original 58nm to the final 0nm (two edges merged), the sidewall angle decreased from the original 58 degree to the final 12 degree, and the bottom distance decreased from the original 162nm to the final 78nm. In discussion of the mechanism of the morphological evolution of nanoscale pit during heat treatment, we have found that the heating condition leads the morphological evolution are low pressure and high temperature. From the temp-pressure phase diagram, we find that the condition corresponds with the thermal desorption mechanism. Thermal desorption occurs in accordance with the low oxygen pressure and high temperature environment. In this condition, the reaction of silicon and silicon-dioxide will format silicon monoxide, which is a gas molecular. (Si + SiO2 → 2SiO (g) ↑) Through this reaction makes SiO2 desorption from the surface of silicon substrate. Meanwhile, during the process of SiO2 desorption will lead to the surface self-diffusion of silicon atoms, they will diffuse to the SiO2 sidewall and join the formation of SiO. From the above result, we could reasonably speculate that the surface self-diffusion of silicon atom result in the morphological change of the nanoscale pit. Therefore, we review the process flow and try to find which process step could possibly make the SiO2 formation on Silicon substrate. The silicon substrate with nanoscale pit was fabricated by RIE process, before the growth of germanium quantum dots, the sample will go through the RCA clean. The final step of RCA clean will use Hydrogen Peroxide Solution (H2O2) dip. Since H2O2 is a strong oxidizing agent, so it will make about 1 to 2 nm of native oxide growth on the surface of silicon substrate. After diluted (DI water 50: HF 1) hydrofluoric acid cleaning, thin native oxide will be etched out from the surface of silicon substrate. Meanwhile, silicon surfaces etched in HF become hydrophobic if no oxide is left on the surface and surfaces with hydrogen termination are similar to organic surfaces and do not interact with water. Therefore, it would against the growth of silicon dioxide again and normally the passivation time would last for 1 to 2 hours. In heat treatment process, the silicon substrate will stay in the load-lock chamber until the pressure of main processing chamber lower as ultra-high vacuum. Normally, vacuum pumping to ultra-high vacuum level takes 3 to 4 hours. So we speculate that during the vacuum pumping, native oxide layer would form on the silicon surface again. Because of the ambient of load-lock has sufficient oxygen to react with the silicon surface. During heat treatment, the oxide desorption phenomenon will occur and accompany the surface self-diffusion of silicon atom in the same time. Finally, silicon atom diffusion leads to the morphological change of the nanoscale pit. No matter we choice MBE or CVD method to fabricate the Ge QDs, there is necessary to go through in-situ heat treatment.

Titanium isopropoxide, diethyl zinc, and deionized water were sources for Ti, Zn, and O, respectively. The Ti doping was then achieved by growing ZnO and TiO 2 alternately. A hampered growth mode of ZnO on TiO 2 layer was confirmed by comparing the thicknesses measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry with the expected. It was also found that the locations of the (100) diffraction peaks shift towards lower diffraction angles as Ti concentration increased. For all samples, optical transmittance over 80% was obtained in the visible region. The sample with ALD cycle ratio of ZnO/TiO 2 being 20 had the lowest resistivity of 8.874 × 10 −4 Ω cm.

This method of catalyst stabilization alleviates the need to employ precious metals (e.g., platinum) in liquid‐phase catalytic processing. The alumina overcoat initially covers the catalyst surface completely. By using solid state NMR spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and electron microscopy, it was shown that high temperature treatment opens porosity in the overcoat by forming crystallites of γ‐Al 2 O 3 .

The first two ALD cycles increased the Al KLL signal, whereas they did not increase the O KLL signal. Al₂O₃ bulk-film growth started from the third cycle. These observations indicated that the Al₂O₃/InGaAs interface was formed by reduction of the surface oxides with TMA. In order to investigate the effect of surface-oxide reduction on metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) properties, capacitors and field-effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated by changing the TMA dosage during the interface formation stage.

(2007) applied evaporation techniques for preparation of a gate stack with ~20 nm thick SiO 2 dielectric layer on graphene.They used p-type Si(100) wafers with a boron doping concentration of 10 15 cm -3 , which were oxydized to a SiO 2 thickness of 300 nm.On these wafers, micromechanically exfoliated graphene flakes were sticked.The Ti/Au source and drain electrodes were prepared using optical lift-off lithography.Next, electron beam lift-off lithography was applied to define a top gate electrode on top of the graphene flake covered with the dielectric (Fig. 1a).Lemme et al. were first to demonstrate that the combined effect of back and top gates can be applied to graphene devices.However, measurements of the back-gate characteristics before www.intechopen.com",intech ebooks,,ebook platform,9,"['https://openalex.org/W1635273272', 'https://openalex.org/W1901415922', 'https://openalex.org/W1927677023', 'https://openalex.org/W1951446495', 'https://openalex.org/W1998860239', 'https://openalex.org/W2014694192', 'https://openalex.org/W2021774822', 'https://openalex.org/W2038293987', 'https://openalex.org/W2039062869', 'https://openalex.org/W2041392466', 'https://openalex.org/W2057892740', 'https://openalex.org/W2058122340', 'https://openalex.org/W2058834453', 'https://openalex.org/W2074596748', 'https://openalex.org/W2074917161', 'https://openalex.org/W2084324487', 'https://openalex.org/W2087899039', 'https://openalex.org/W2092405489', 'https://openalex.org/W2097773259', 'https://openalex.org/W2100998947', 'https://openalex.org/W2110835769', 'https://openalex.org/W2121990892', 'https://openalex.org/W2147199374', 'https://openalex.org/W2151097667', 'https://openalex.org/W2152251293', 'https://openalex.org/W2156805743', 'https://openalex.org/W2160799621', 'https://openalex.org/W2165190656', 'https://openalex.org/W3098709496', 'https://openalex.org/W3104808604', 'https://openalex.org/W3104914545', 'https://openalex.org/W3104929553']",Alles,,False,

Spectroscopic ellipsometry and medium energy ion scattering were used to measure the thicknesses and compositions of the deposited films. After postdeposition annealing, a metastable cubic phase is found to be stabilized in the films. Capacitance–voltage measurements have been used to characterize the dielectric properties of deposited films before and after two annealing regimes. The equivalent oxide thickness of an as-deposited sample with nominal high-κ dielectric thickness of 6 nm is circa 2.8 nm from which the dielectric constant 31 was calculated. The leakage current density is in order of 10−6 A/cm2 at ±1 V.

To obtain the most qualitative and uniform surface passivation advanced cleaning development is required. The studied pre-deposition treatments include an HF (Si-H) or oxidizing (Si-OH) last step and finish with simple hot-air drying or more sophisticated Marangoni drying. To examine the quality and uniformity of surface passivation - after cleaning and Al2O3 deposition - carrier density imaging (CDI) and quasi-steady-state photo-conductance (QSSPC) are applied. A hydrophilic surface clean that leads to improved surface passivation level is found. Si-H starting surfaces lead to equivalent passivation quality but worse passivation uniformity. The hydrophilic surface clean is preferred because it is thermodynamically stable, enables higher and more uniform ALD growth and consequently exhibits better surface passivation uniformity.",world conference on photovoltaic energy conversion,,conference,10,[],Vermang,,False,

Samples were subjected to rapid thermal annealing for 30 s at 610, 615, 620, and 800 °C in a N 2 atmosphere. At these temperatures, the polycrystalline ZnO layer in a TFT channel rapidly degraded to amorphous, and in the Al 2 O 3 layer of a gate oxide layer of the TFT, a ZnAl 2 O 4 spinel structure was formed because of Al and Zn diffusion. This spinel structure was observed to be independently nucleated, and there were no specific postgrowth crystallographic orientation relations. Additionally, in electrical properties of ZnO‐TFTs with ZnO/Al 2 O 3 layers, typical TFT characteristics was shown until the annealing temperature increased to 600 °C, and the V th gradually decreased from 4.2, 3 to 1.8 V. However, in the 700 °C annealed case, the TFT devices are always opened, and the ZnAl 2 O 4 generation and the ZnO layer degradation was related to the drastic changes of these ZnO‐TFTs characteristics.

Mackus,,"Platinum is a material that finds many applications in the fields of nanoelectronics and catalysis due to its catalytic activity, chemical stability, and high work function. The thin film deposition technique of atomic layer deposition (ALD) is gaining increasing interest for the deposition of Pt ultrathin films and nanoparticles, since it is able to deposit on demanding surfaces such as high-aspect-ratio structures and porous materials. In this dissertation, ALD of Pt was studied, aimed at the development of a novel bottom-up nanopatterning approach. Conventional patterning by lithography involves resist-films and lift-off steps that may yield compatibility issues with the envisioned nanoscale building blocks of future nanodevices, e.g. nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. The main goal was to develop a nanopatterning approach that enables direct and local fabrication of high-quality nanostructures without the need for additional lithography steps. Since ALD film growth depends critically on the properties of the surface, it is possible to chemically tailor the surface properties to achieve area-selective deposition. For the development of the nanopatterning technique, detailed understanding of the surface reactions of the ALD processes of noble metals turned out to be crucial. The reaction mechanism of Pt ALD was studied by evaluating which surface reactions take place at the catalytically active Pt surface during ALD, based on analogous surface reactions reported in surface science literature. This study led to new insights into the surface reactions that take place during the growth, the saturation of the half-reactions, and the temperature dependence of the process. Inspired by the conclusions drawn from the reaction mechanism study, an approach for plasma-assisted ALD at low substrate temperatures was developed. It was demonstrated that this new process enables the deposition of Pt at temperatures down to room temperature. Consequently, the Pt can be deposited on various temperature sensitive substrates such as polymers, textile and paper, which significantly broadens the possibilities for applications of Pt ALD. Furthermore, the nucleation behavior of Pt ALD was studied using spectroscopic ellipsometry and transmission electron microscopy. It was established that the pressure employed during the O2 half-reaction of the ALD process governs the nucleation behavior, which can be exploited for controlling the nucleation of the Pt. This control enables nanoparticle deposition, thin film deposition with minimal nucleation delay, and areaselective ALD for nanopatterning. The developed nanopatterning approach is based on a combination of ALD with electron beam induced deposition (EBID). EBID is a direct-write patterning technique with nanometer scale resolution but its main drawback is that it gives material of poor quality. The newly developed approach comprises the deposition of a thin seed layer by EBID, followed by area-selective ALD. It was established that this so-called direct-write ALD technique yields high-quality Pt material (~100% pure, 12 µOcm), and an enhanced throughput comparable to that of electron beam lithography (EBL), while it allows for patterning of nanoscale line deposits of only ~10 nm in width. To validate whether direct-write ALD is suitable for contacting applications, it was demonstrated that contacts can be patterned on multi- and single-walled carbon nanotubes. Additionally, it was evaluated whether direct-write ALD is a suitable technique for the fabrication of carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNTFET). CNTFETs were synthesized by patterning of Pt contacts using direct-write ALD on single-walled carbon nanotubes. It was demonstrated by electrical characterization that these devices behave as a p-type transistors. In conclusion, in this work a novel bottom-up nanopatterning approach has been developed that is completely resist-free, and is especially suitable for the patterning of contacts on sensitive nanomaterials. In addition, the reaction mechanisms studies led to atomic level understanding of the surface reactions of Pt ALD, and thereby will contribute to the use of Pt ALD in a wide variety of applications.",,,,2,[],Mackus,,False,

Due to its characteristic self-limiting surface reactions, ALD offers sub-nanometer precision of film growth, uniform deposition over large substrate areas and conformal deposition in structures of high aspect ratio. Plasma-assisted ALD is a variant to the conventional thermal ALD technique where the surface is exposed to a plasma during the second half-cycle. The use of a plasma allows for more freedom in processing conditions and for a wider range of material properties compared with the conventional thermally-driven ALD method. Although it has been known from plasma-based techniques that photons and ions can also play an important role during processing, their contribution has never been systematically addressed for the specific case of plasma-assisted ALD. In this dissertation work, the plasma-surface interaction in plasma-assisted ALD is investigated. In the first part of this dissertation, the basics and status of plasma-assisted ALD have been discussed. A classification of plasma-capable ALD configurations has been made and examples for plasma-based processes of metal-oxide, metal-nitride and pure metal thin films prepared by plasma-assisted ALD have been used to illustrate its merits compared to thermal ALD. Several challenges of plasma-assisted ALD, such as plasma-induced damage and surface-recombination of radicals, have also been identified. Several reported emerging applications of plasma-assisted ALD have been reviewed. Since the deposition of thin films at low temperatures, and in particular at room temperature, is one of the most promising application areas of plasma-assisted ALD, special attention has been dedicated to this topic. Taking the deposition processes of Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 as examples, criteria for viable deposition at room-temperature using plasma-assisted ALD and ozone-based ALD have been identified. The second part deals with the identification and evaluation of ions and photons during plasma-assisted ALD. The presence and importance of ions have been discussed for four reactor configurations commonly used during plasma-assisted ALD. It has been shown that the energy and flux of ions towards the substrate surface is mainly determi-ned by the reactor configuration, the gas pressure, the plasma power, and the electrical potential of the substrate stage. Under processing conditions typically employed during plasma-assisted ALD, ion energies are up to several tens of eV and ion-induced damage is therefore not a major issue during most processes. The energy flux of the ions toward the substrate surface can however be sufficient to promote some beneficial physical effects such as enhanced ligand-desorption, adatom migration and displacement of lattice atoms. With respect to the optical emission of plasmas, it has been shown that energetic vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons can be present in plasmas, which are able to induce electrical defects at interfaces. By varying the gas pressure and the plasma power, however, the influence of ions and photons can be suppressed. The third part of this dissertation discusses the exploitation of the presence of ions during plasma-assisted ALD using substrate biasing in order to affect the properties of metal-oxide films. The ion energy was enhanced by applying a substrate bias signal at radio frequency to the substrate stage in a reactor equipped with an inductively-coupled plasma source. Alternatively, substrate-tuned biasing was used where no additional power source is required and where the substrate potential can be varied by enhancing capacitive coupling using an external electrical circuit. It has been demonstrated that both biasing techniques are viable and that ion energies have been increased up to a few hundreds of eV. The influence of these high-energy ions on ALD-synthesized thin films was illustrated for Al2O3, Co3O4 and TiO2 and it has been demonstrated that thin film properties can be tailored in terms of thin-film stress, composition, density and crystallinity when ion energies are carefully tuned. To conclude, in this dissertation work important aspects of the plasma-assisted ALD technique have been elucidated leading to a better understanding of the fundamental and technological opportunities and limitations of the technique. The work will therefore contribute to the advancement and the acceptance of plasma-assisted ALD in science and technology.",,,,2,[],Profijt,,False,

However, required high operating temperatures limit their widespread use. The two ways to reduce the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells is to decrease the thickness of the electrolyte and to use new materials that have lower ion resistivities. In this study, both methods were employed. Currently, yttrium stabilized zirconium is the material used in solid oxide fuel cells as the electrolyte, and in this study cerium oxide was examined to be a potential replacement. To decrease the thickness of the electrolyte, thin films production techniques can be used. One technique for making thin films is atomic layer deposition, also known as ALD, which uses alternating saturative surface reactions. ALD creates films that have good conformality, are pin-hole free, and thickness is easily controlled. In this study, the atomic layer deposition of cerium oxide was studied for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells as the electrolyte and anode.

Knoops,Deposition,"One major difficulty in maintaining the size reduction in electronic devices is the controlled deposition of high-quality thin films with the right film properties. Besides this trend of miniaturization in information processing technology, i.e., the More-Moore trend, there has been another trend for non-digital technology which is designated as More-than-Moore. is the trend towards diversification within electronic devices, in which multiple functionalities are integrated into a single unit of the device. All-solid-state 3D-integrated micro-batteries are a good example of the More-than-Moore approach as they integrate energy storage, which is a traditionally macroscopic non-semiconductor technology, into a chip-size unit using techniques compatible with semiconductor technology. In all-solid-state 3D-integrated microbatteries, the various battery materials have to be deposited as thin films. Furthermore, to achieve a high capacity per footprint area on the chip surface, the thin films have to be deposited in high-aspect-ratio structures etched in the Si substrate. Controlled deposition of high-quality films with the right film properties is therefore also a challenge in this research field. A thin-film deposition technique which typically exhibits a high material quality, a high uniformity, precise growth control, and an excellent conformality is atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD has the potential to be an enabling technology for a wide range of applications. To be able to develop new ALD processes and materials, detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the ALD process itself are essential. Besides the conventional thermallydriven ALD processes, the usage of energy-enhanced methods is considered, i.e., plasma-assisted and ozone-based processes. Plasma-assisted ALD can for instance facilitate deposition of conductive films. Furthermore, oxygen plasma and ozone gas are well-suited to grow oxide thin films even at low substrate temperatures. The reactive reactants used can, however, recombine at surfaces which could complicate deposition in 3D structures. In this thesis new energy-enhanced ALD processes are developed and further understanding is obtaned on their reaction mechanisms. Also the ability of energy-enhanced ALD processes to conformally coat 3D structures is investigated. Moreover, the application of ALD in energy technologies is further explored by focussing on solid-state 3D-integrated batteries. The use of ALD in Li-ion battery synthesis is relatively unexplored and therefore the potential of ALD for Li-ion batteries is reviewed in this work. Not only the More-than-Moore application of all-solid-state 3D-integrated microbatteries is considered, but also larger-scale Li-ion battery concepts that can benefit from ALD as well. Nanostructuring is targeted as a solution to achieve the improvements required for implementing batteries in a wide range of applications. The potential of ALD is discussed for three battery concepts that can be distinguished, i.e., particle-based electrodes, 3D-structured electrodes, and 3D solid-state micro-batteries. It is discussed that a large range of materials can be deposited by ALD and recent demonstrations of improvements in battery technology by ALD are used to exemplify its large potential. Conformal deposition of conductive materials is needed in a variety of More-than-Moore applications, e.g., for electrodes and current collectors. TiN and TaN deposited by plasma-assisted ALD were demonstrated to serve as Li barrier and anode current collector for micro-batteries and also as Cu diffusion barrier in advanced interconnect technology for 3D-integration. Furthermore, conformal deposition of TiN films by plasma-assisted ALD was demonstrated. For some electrodes, such as the cathode current collector, a highly-chemically-stable conductive material is needed. A plasma-assisted ALD process was developed for the deposition of Pt films with excellent material properties in terms of density and resistivity. By using an additional H2-gas reduction-step, the deposition of Pt at low temperatures with good material properties was achieved, which can be of interest for deposition of Pt on plastics. Furthermore, using longer plasma exposure times, PtO2 could be deposited which is difficult to obtain by ALD. Using mass spectrometry, the reaction mechanism of plasma-assisted ALD of TaNx was investigated. For this process the reaction products released from the surface during the plasma step were found to interact with the plasma. Furthermore, the material properties of TaNx are influenced to a large extent by this interaction. Interaction of ALD reaction products with the plasma is expected to be of general significance for plasma-assisted ALD processes. The reaction products of the thermal ALD process for Pt were quantified using insitu gas-phase infrared spectroscopy and a reaction mechanism was proposed. The film growth was found to be ruled by the surface coverage of dissociatively chemisorbed oxygen with which the precursor molecules interact. The capability of plasma-assisted ALD to deposit in 3D structures was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that deposition in 3D structures can be classified in three regimes: i.e., reaction-limited, diffusionlimited, and recombination-limited. For low values of the recombination probability, or, conformal deposition in high-aspect-ratio structures can still be achieved, as also experimentally observed for several metal oxides. For high values of the recombination probability, r, as appears to be the case for many metals, achieving a reasonable conformality becomes challenging, especially for aspect ratios >10. Sufficient conformal deposition was demonstrated for both the TiN and the Pt plasma-assisted ALD processes. For the medium aspect ratios targeted for the Li-ion micro-batteries, plasma-assisted ALD should be able to conformally deposit all materials. Similarly the loss of O3 in 3D structures was investigated where the loss of O3 on several materials was tested. To determine O3 recombination probabilities over a wide range, a method was developed using high-aspect-ratio capillaries at the inlet to a mass spectrometer. O3 typically has higher loss on materials such as MnOx and Co3O4, which can also be considered as battery materials. Several material systems were investigated and a considerable amount of fundamental understanding in ALD was generated. In particular, understanding of energy-enhanced ALD processes and understanding of their ability to coat 3D structures conformally are essential for many new application fields in which these techniques will be required.",,,,1,[],Knoops,,False,

Talghader,"Deposition, Optical coating, Pulsed Laser Deposition","Abstract : This report describes an investigation of the properties of optical coating oxides deposited by atomic layer deposition. Specifically, two oxides were chosen as indicative of the group as a whole: aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and hafnium oxide (HfO2). Uniform films and nanolaminates (films with inserted layers of alternate materials) were deposited and tested for thermal conductivity. absorption, and laser damage threshold, among other properties. Significant effort went into the analysis of the thermal conductivities of the films since thermal breakdown is particularly relevant to directed energy applications. The interface thermal resistance in hafnia-alumina nanolaminates is very low and does not dominate the film thermal conductivity. The degree of crystallinity of these films appears to have a much larger effect on thermal conductivity than that of interface density. Cryogenic measurements show partial agreement with both the minimum thermal conductivity model for disordered solids and the diffuse mismatch model of interface resistance. Absorption measurements show results less than or near 1ppm, which matches or exceeds the performance of the best films deposited by other methods.",,,,0,[],Talghader,,False,

However, with the trend of scaling down in International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), seeking for higher-κ dielectric oxides will be the key to meet the requirement for 22 nm and 15 nm node of CMOS technology. Lanthanum titanate (LTO) had been reported to have high dielectric constant and high crystallization temperature, which is taking the merit of TiO2 in high permittivity and La2O3 in thermal stability. Thus the higher-κ dielectric LTO is expected to have its potential in future high-κ dielectric. The LTO films is deposited on HfO2 in stacks structure via atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique in this study. The precursor systems used for deposition of lanthanum titanates were Tetrakis(dimethylamino) Titanium (TDMAT) + water and tris(N-N’-diisopropylformamidinato) Lanthanum (La(iPr2-FMD)3) + oxygen plasma. The electrical characteristics were measured in C-V and I-V relations, and the microstructure of thin films was inspected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The LTO film is observed to diffuse in HfO2 through heat treatment, and yield in a new high-κ material which exhibits better properties than traditional HfO2 thin film and displays higher permittivity of 34.5 and lower equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of 0.69 nm with a low leakage current of 10-2 A/cm2.",清華大學材料科學工程學系學位論文,,journal,0,[],喻詩維,,False,

Templated ALD provides advantages over alternative synthesis techniques, including improved film uniformity and conformality as well as atomic‐scale control over morphology and composition. Nanostructured Pt ALD films are demonstrated with morphological control provided by the Pt precursor exposure time and the number of ALD cycles. With these approaches, Pt films with enhanced surface areas, as characterized by roughness factors as large as 310, are reproducibly synthesized. Additionally, nanostructured PtIr alloy films of controlled composition and morphology are demonstrated by templated ALD, with compositions varying systematically from pure Pt to pure Ir.

In this work we report on a novel alternative and disruptive technology concept of Spatially-divided Deep Reactive Ion Etching, S-DRIE, where the process is converted from the time-divided into the spatially divided regime. The spatial division can be accomplished by inert gas bearing 'curtains' of heights down to ∼20 μm. These curtains confine the reactive gases to individual (often linear) injection slots constructed in a gas injector head. By horizontally moving the substrate back and forth under the head one can realize the alternate exposures to the overall cycle. Another improvement in the spatially divided approach is the replacement of the CVD-based C4F8 passivation steps by ALD-based oxide (e.g. SiO2) deposition cycles.

Cronauer,Fischer–Tropsch process,"Argonne National Laboratory is carrying out a research program to create, prepare, and evaluate catalysts to promote Fischer-Tropsch (FT) chemistry - specifically, the reaction of hydrogen with carbon monoxide to form long-chain hydrocarbons. In addition to needing high activity, it is desirable that the catalysts have high selectivity and stability with respect to both mechanical strength and aging properties. The broad goal is to produce diesel fraction components and avoiding excess yields of both light hydrocarbons and heavy waxes. Originally the goal was to prepare shape-selective catalysts that would limit the formation of long-chain products and yet retain the active metal sites in a protected 'cage.' Such catalysts were prepared with silica-containing fractal cages. The activity was essentially the same as that of catalysts without the cages. We are currently awaiting follow-up experiments to determine the attrition strength of these catalysts. A second experimental stage was undertaken to prepare and evaluate active FT catalysts formed by atomic-layer deposition [ALD] of active components on supported membranes and particulate supports. The concept was that of depositing active metals (i.e. ruthenium, iron or cobalt) upon membranes with well defined flow channels of small diameter and length such that the catalytic activity and product molecular weight distribution could be controlled. In order to rapidly evaluate the catalytic membranes, the ALD coating processes were performed in an 'exploratory mode' in which ALD procedures from the literature appropriate for coating flat surfaces were applied to the high surface area membranes. Consequently, the Fe and Ru loadings in the membranes were likely to be smaller than those expected for complete monolayer coverage. In addition, there was likely to be significant variation in the Fe and Ru loading among the membranes due to difficulties in nucleating these materials on the aluminum oxide surfaces. The first series of experiments using coated membranes demonstrated that the technology needed further improvement. Specifically, observed catalytic FT activity was low. This low activity appeared to be due to: (1) low available surface area, (2) atomic deposition techniques that needed improvements, and (3) insufficient preconditioning of the catalyst surface prior to FT testing. Therefore, experimentation was expanded to the use of particulate silica supports having defined channels and reasonably high surface area. This later experimentation will be discussed in the next progress report. Subsequently, we plan to evaluate membranes after the ALD techniques are improved with a careful study to control and quantify the Fe and Ru loadings. The preconditioning of these surfaces will also be further developed. (A number of improvements have been made with particulate supports; they will be discussed in the subsequent report.) In support of the above, there was an opportunity to undertake a short study of cobalt/promoter/support interaction using the Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne. Five catalysts and a reference cobalt oxide were characterized during a temperature programmed EXAFS/XANES experimental study with the combined effort of Argonne and the Center for Applied Energy Research (CAER) of the University of Kentucky. This project was completed, and it resulted in an extensive understanding of the preconditioning step of reducing Co-containing FT catalysts. A copy of the resulting manuscript has been submitted and accepted for publication. A similar project was undertaken with iron-containing FT catalysts; the data is currently being studied.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W208810203', 'https://openalex.org/W2128567477', 'https://openalex.org/W2334679715', 'https://openalex.org/W2561201275', 'https://openalex.org/W4243753222', 'https://openalex.org/W586102426', 'https://openalex.org/W586966134']",Cronauer,,False,

From film analysis by spectroscopic ellipsometry, four-point probe measurement and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, data on growth rate, resistivity and composition are presented. The deposition parameters were adjusted in order to obtain films with a homogenous film thickness and resistivity. Lowering of the plasma pressure reduced the specific resistance of the Nb films. The nitrogen content could be varied by admixing nitrogen into the plasma, and thereby for the first time a low resistivity ALD film containing the stoichiometric carbon-free NbN phase was obtained. Furthermore, the cycle period could be reduced by increasing the deposition temperature. Compared to other deposition methods, PEALD was shown to be an excellent method for the fabrication of low-resistivity metallic films at a reduced process temperature.

ZnO thin films can be prepared by thermal evaporation, rf-sputtering, atomic layer deposition, chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel, laser ablation and spray pyrolysis technique. Spray pyrolysis has received much attention because of its simplicity and low cost. In this study, large area and highly uniform polycrystalline ZnO thin films were produced by spray pyrolysis using a home-made spraying system on glass substrates at 450 degrees C. The electrical, optical and structural properties of the ZnO films were enhanced by annealing the thin films in nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction revealed that the films are polycrystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The preferential orientation did not change with annealing, but XRD patterns revealed that some very weak lines had grown. There was no noticeable increase in the grain size. The transmittance of the films increased as a result of annealing. It was concluded that post-deposition annealing is essential to improve the quality of the ZnO thin films.

Due the incorporation of a high density of negative charges near the interface surface and a low defect density a very good passivation can be achieved. Today, aluminum oxide layers are predominantly deposited by atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Reactive sputtering is an alternative not requiring trimethylaluminum. Nevertheless, there are doubts concerning the passivation quality of sputtered aluminum oxide. In this contribution we analyse the influence of deposition parameters on the properties of the sputtered layers. Measurements of interface defects density and the density of fixed charges at the interface can explain a good passivation quality after firing. Additionally, results for LFC-PERC solar cells are presented showing a statistically significant improve in efficiency compared to standard BSF solar cells. This can be explained by a lower recombination rate and a higher reflectivity at the rear side of the solar cell.",world conference on photovoltaic energy conversion,,conference,5,['https://openalex.org/W1983124966'],Preu,,False,

Thin (0.6-6.0 nm) SiO2 layers were prepared by means of HF etch and thermal oxidation on c-Si wafers prior to the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of Al2O3. Subsequently, the Al2O3 layer was deposited and annealed and the films were characterized using Microwave Detected Photoconductivity (MDP), Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) and Capacitance-Voltage (C(V)) measurements. The best passivation effect was found for a 2.0 nm SiO2 interface. Thicker interfaces reduce the effective minority carrier lifetime due to the formation of positive charges in the dielectric. C(V) hysteresis curves show that the charge density in Al2O3 is not stable but a function of the applied bias voltage and thickness of the SiO2 interface. The change in charge density could be described by trapping of electrons from Si into Al2O3 with SiO2 acting as a tunnel barrier. Since trapped electrons are part of the negative charges in Al2O3, a thin SiO2 interface is required to realize the high field effect passivation of Al2O3",world conference on photovoltaic energy conversion,,conference,5,['https://openalex.org/W3147289055'],Mikolajick,,False,

The technique used for the deposition of the Al2O3 layers is spatial Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), for its industrial relevance due to the high deposition speed and low Trimethyl-Aluminum (TMA) consumption. After analyzing the surface passivation properties, we will describe how Al2O3 can be integrated in an i-PERC process flow in a simple and cost-effective way, while maintaining high levels of solar cell efficiency. In particular, a special effort is devoted in finding solutions for process simplification and in the reduction of the cost per wafer (€/W) of the spatial ALD process step. Top efficiencies of 20.1 % and 20.6 % have been reached (Cz-Si, 6 inch cells) when coupling a spatial ALD Al2O3 rear passivation to a standard i-PERC integration flow with front Ag-screen printed or Ni/Cu/Ag plated contacts, respectively. Besides passivation, ALD Al2O3 can also be used as doping source of aluminum to form localized p back surface field (BSF) regions at the rear contact by means of laser processing. In this way, dielectric opening and BSF are formed simultaneously and firing step is not needed anymore, leading both to a suppression of Al2O3 blistering and optical enhancement. This process is a suitable complement of front contact formation based on plating schemes. Ni/Cu/Ag-plated solar cells with rear laser doping from ALD Al2O3 layers have been fabricated with efficiencies topping 20.4 % (FF = 79.7 %) and outperforming the control group featuring local BSF formed via a firing step.",world conference on photovoltaic energy conversion,,conference,5,"['https://openalex.org/W1548184108', 'https://openalex.org/W1653224167', 'https://openalex.org/W1886464426', 'https://openalex.org/W1977053792', 'https://openalex.org/W1980428547', 'https://openalex.org/W1992063385', 'https://openalex.org/W1998371109', 'https://openalex.org/W200364798', 'https://openalex.org/W2013200839', 'https://openalex.org/W2018152850', 'https://openalex.org/W2049579945', 'https://openalex.org/W2078955342', 'https://openalex.org/W2117358658', 'https://openalex.org/W2135796605', 'https://openalex.org/W2146943137', 'https://openalex.org/W2152152824', 'https://openalex.org/W2160563816', 'https://openalex.org/W2201719243', 'https://openalex.org/W2288549561', 'https://openalex.org/W2310104960', 'https://openalex.org/W2363270461', 'https://openalex.org/W2526874354']",Hallam,,False,

Transition from discontinuous to continuous gold coverage takes place at the layer thicknesses 10 to 15 nm and this threshold remains practically unchanged after the annealing at the temperatures below 200°C. The annealing at 300°C, however, leads to significant rearrangement of the gold layer and the transition threshold increases to 70 nm. Significant carbon contamination and the presence of oxidized structures on gold-coated samples are observed in XPS spectra. Gold coating leads to a decrease in the sample surface roughness. Annealing at 300°C of pristine PTFE and gold-coated PTFE results in significant increase of the sample surface roughness.",nanoscale research letters,"['1556-276X', '1931-7573']",journal,29,"['https://openalex.org/W1964558909', 'https://openalex.org/W1970142364', 'https://openalex.org/W1973394278', 'https://openalex.org/W1983334862', 'https://openalex.org/W1983880190', 'https://openalex.org/W1987419192', 'https://openalex.org/W1995198733', 'https://openalex.org/W2016962388', 'https://openalex.org/W2024026894', 'https://openalex.org/W2031498913', 'https://openalex.org/W2033885096', 'https://openalex.org/W2076687751', 'https://openalex.org/W2086060010', 'https://openalex.org/W2104222848', 'https://openalex.org/W2109863980', 'https://openalex.org/W2125976635', 'https://openalex.org/W2132070609', 'https://openalex.org/W2135160315', 'https://openalex.org/W2136599439', 'https://openalex.org/W2137335948', 'https://openalex.org/W2146236590', 'https://openalex.org/W2153927706', 'https://openalex.org/W2156043887', 'https://openalex.org/W2156901760', 'https://openalex.org/W2323174283', 'https://openalex.org/W4240092015']",Siegel,,False,

The most distinctive feature of LaAlO3 as compared with Hf-based high-k materials is the thermal stability at the interface with Si, which suppresses the formation of a low-permittivity Si oxide interfacial layer. Careful selection of the film deposition conditions has enabled successful deposition of an LaAlO3 gate dielectric film with an equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of 0.31 nm. Direct contact with Si has been revealed to cause significant tensile strain to the Si in the interface region. The high stability of the effective work function with respect to the annealing conditions has been demonstrated through comparison with Hf-based dielectrics. It has also been shown that the effective work function can be tuned over a wide range by controlling the La/(La + Al) atomic ratio.

The primary scattering mechanism in nanosystems is interface scattering, and the structure and composition around these interfaces can affect scattering rates and, therefore, device thermal resistances. In this work, the thermal boundary conductance (the inverse of the thermal boundary resistance) is measured using a pump-probe thermoreflectance technique on aluminum films grown on silicon substrates that are subjected to various pre-Al-deposition surface treatments. The Si surfaces are characterized with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to determine mean surface roughness. The measured thermal boundary conductance decreases as Si surface roughness increases. In addition, stripping the native oxide layer on the surface of the Si substrate immediately prior to Al film deposition causes the thermal boundary conductance to increase. The measured data are then compared to an extension of the diffuse mismatch model that accounts for interfacial mixing and structure around the interface.","2010 14th international heat transfer conference, volume 3",,conference,26,[],Hopkins,,False,

The growth of LS multilayers on quartz slides was monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy, and the absorbance at 205 nm as well as at 280 nm was found to linearly increase with the number of layers. The formation of LS multilayers on fibers surfaces was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The XPS results showed that the surface contents of the characteristic elements, S and Cu, of LS multilayers were increased with the number of layers, which suggests the deposition of LS-Cu2+ complexes on cellulose fibers. Furthermore, there was a good linear relationship between the calculated surface LS content and the increment of LS layers. The AFM morphology results confirmed that the cellulose microfibrils on fiber surface were gradually covered by LS particles, resulting in the increase of surface roughness as self-assembly proceeded. The hydrophobicity of cellulose fiber probed by dynamic contact angle was significantly increased due to LBL self-assembly of LS on its surface. The initial contact angle was increased from 0° to 115° as the cellulose fibers were modified with a 5-layer LS multilayer. The reduction rate of the contact angle was dependent on the number of layers. When the cellulose fiber was modified by a 5-layer LS multilayer, the contact angle shifted from 115 to 98° after 0.12 s, suggesting some degree of hydrophobic character. Therefore, this technique provides a simple but effective way for promoting hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers in a controllable manner.",bioresources,['1930-2126'],journal,21,"['https://openalex.org/W1503747664', 'https://openalex.org/W1542350890', 'https://openalex.org/W1964894352', 'https://openalex.org/W1979920548', 'https://openalex.org/W1986710419', 'https://openalex.org/W1998595953', 'https://openalex.org/W2005294447', 'https://openalex.org/W2007744989', 'https://openalex.org/W2014827498', 'https://openalex.org/W2014909090', 'https://openalex.org/W2016208439', 'https://openalex.org/W2029193786', 'https://openalex.org/W2038834879', 'https://openalex.org/W2048414110', 'https://openalex.org/W2048584115', 'https://openalex.org/W2056618936', 'https://openalex.org/W2058649105', 'https://openalex.org/W2064057610', 'https://openalex.org/W2065325816', 'https://openalex.org/W2067630730', 'https://openalex.org/W2080766118', 'https://openalex.org/W2081441029', 'https://openalex.org/W2084895845', 'https://openalex.org/W2084956877', 'https://openalex.org/W2089048912', 'https://openalex.org/W2090748776', 'https://openalex.org/W2117208350', 'https://openalex.org/W2141297247', 'https://openalex.org/W2168022187', 'https://openalex.org/W2170750193', 'https://openalex.org/W2330188839', 'https://openalex.org/W2524979824', 'https://openalex.org/W4251464006']",Li,,False,

In this work, the passivation quality and uniformity of the experimental spatially-separated ALD Al2O3 films are evaluated and compared to conventional temporal ALD Al2O3, by use of quasi-steady-state photo-conductance (QSSPC) and carrier density imaging (CDI). It is shown that spatially-separated Al2O3 films of increasing thickness provide an increasing surface passivation level. Moreover, on p-type CZ Si, 10 and 30 nm spatial ALD Al2O3 layers can achieve the same level of surface passivation as equivalent temporal ALD Al2O3 layers. In contrast, on n-type FZ Si, spatially-separated ALD Al2O3 samples generally do not reach the same optimal passivation quality as equivalent conventional temporal ALD Al2O3 samples. Nevertheless, after firing, 30 nm of spatially-separated ALD Al2O3 on 250 µm thick n-type (1-5 O.cm) FZ Si wafers can lead to effective surface recombination velocities as low as 2.9 cm/s, compared to 1.9 cm/s in the case of 30 nm of temporal ALD Al2O3.",world conference on photovoltaic energy conversion,,conference,2,[],Vermang,,False,

The transition metal substrates take the role of the support and allow due to their catalytic activity the growth of perfect layers by means of chemical vapor deposition. The layers are sp2 hybridized honeycomb networks with strong in plane sigma and weaker pi bonds to the substrate and to the adsorbates. This hierarchy in bond strength causes anisotropic elastic properties, where the sp2 layers are stiff in plane and soft out of plane. A corrugation of these layers imposes a third hierarchy level in bond energies, with lateral bonding to molecular objects with sizes between 1 and 5 nanometer. This extra bond energies are in the range of thermal energies kT at room temperature and are particularly interesting for nanotechnology. The concomitant template function will be discussed. The peculiar bond hierarchy also imposes intercalation as another property of sp2 layer systems. Last but not least sp2 layer systems are particularly robust, i.e. survive immersion into liquids, which is a promise for sp2 layers being useful outside ultra high vacuum. The Chapter shortly recalls the synthesis, describes the atomic and electronic structure, is followed by a discussion of properties like intercalation and the use of sp2 layers on metals as tunneling junctions or as templates. The Chapter ends with an Appendix that summarizes the basics of atomic and electronic structure of honeycomb lattices. Of course the Chapter does not cover all aspects of sp2 single layers.

Connelly, 2002).Here, a specific band or frequency needs to be filtered from a wide range of mixed signals.Active filter circuits can be designed to accomplish this task by combining the properties of high-pass and low-pass into a band-pass filter.Amorphous silicon carbon tandem structures, through an adequate engineering design of the multiple layers' thickness, absorption coefficient and dark conductivities (P.Louro et al., 2007) can accomplish this function.

Dingemans,"Passivation, Deposition","This thesis is concerned with nanolayer surface passivation schemes and corresponding deposition processes, for envisaged applications in crystalline silicon solar cells. Surface passivation, i.e. the reduction of electronic recombination processes at semiconductor surfaces, is essential for realizing high Si solar cell efficiencies. In turn, the increase in the energy conversion efficiency is a major driver for reducing the costs of photovoltaic electricity. However, at present, effective surface passivation schemes have been implemented in only a fraction of industrial Si solar cells. Therefore, the development of suitable surface passivation schemes and related technology is currently a key topic in photovoltaic research. This is underscored by the immense attention that aluminum oxide (Al2O3) has captured in recent years after being introduced as an effective surface passivation material in 2006. Al2O3 thin films appeared to have some advantages over contending technologies for the passivation of the rear side of p-type Si solar cells and for the passivation of the p+ emitter in n-type Si cells. Along with the use of Al2O3, atomic layer deposition (ALD)—with its benefits of submonolayer growth control and excellent uniformity and step-coverage—was also introduced as a novel deposition method in the field of Si photovoltaics. This thesis addresses topics ranging from the fundamental mechanisms that govern the properties of nanolayer surface passivation schemes to the industrial feasibility of the technology. These aspects are closely interwoven, as improved fundamental understanding forms the basis for developing, optimizing, implementing and commercializing the relevant technologies. The focus throughout the thesis is on Al2O3 and on ALD, both of which enabled new opportunities for developing and studying nanolayer surface passivation schemes. A share of the research was carried out in collaboration with strategic partners, including the solar cell manufacturer Q-Cells. The properties of the Al2O3 films were evaluated on multiple levels: Firstly, the surface passivation quality of the films was studied in relation to various technologically relevant parameters such as ALD conditions, annealing recipes, material properties and film thicknesses. It was found, for instance, that Al2O3 films with thicknesses down to 5-10 nm synthesized by plasma-assisted and thermal ALD induced ultralow surface recombination velocities, Seff <5 cm/s, on low resistivity n- and p-type Si in a relatively wide processing parameter window. Secondly, the chemical passivation (i.e., the reduction of the interface defect density) and field-effect passivation by negative fixed charges (i.e., the shielding of electrons from the surface), responsible for the passivation quality of Al2O3, are addressed in detail. While its negative fixed charge density is a distinguishing property relative to other relevant surface passivation materials, it is established that the effective chemical passivation, as demonstrated by very low defect densities of Dit <1011 cm-2 eV-1 at mid gap, also plays a key role in the Al2O3 passivation properties. Finally, the fundamental mechanisms controlling the chemical- and field-effect passivation were addressed experimentally using innovative approaches. For example, the diffusion of hydrogen present in the Al2O3 films (typically ~3 at.%) during annealing was studied with thermal effusion experiments and was correlated with the hydrogenation of interface defects. The latter, in combination with the presence of an interfacial SiO2 layer, are key to the low Dit values achieved by Al2O3. Regarding the field-effect passivation, the thickness of the interfacial SiO2 was identified as a key parameter controlling the negative fixed charge density associated with Al2O3. This experimental study relied on using an ALD SiO2 process for interface engineering with Angstrom resolution. It was combined with diagnostics such as electric-field induced second-harmonic generation for the contactless probing of the changes in charge distribution for thicker SiO2 interlayers. This thesis also addresses surface passivation stacks, such as Al2O3/a-SiNx:H, SiOx/a-SiNx:H and SiO2/Al2O3 stacks. The newly introduced SiO2/Al2O3 stacks are compatible with very low Seff values, regardless of the SiO2 synthesis method. In fact, the use of Al2O3 capping layers enabled an unprecedented high interface quality for low-temperature synthesized SiO2. This appears to be mainly related to a very effective hydrogenation of the remote Si/SiO2 interface during annealing. For both SiO2/Al2O3 and SiO2/a-SiNx:H stacks, field-effect passivation was reduced significantly compared to the corresponding single layers, which can avoid—sometimes undesirable—inversion conditions. Therefore, by using surface passivation stacks, not only the optical and chemical properties, but also the underlying passivation mechanisms can be controlled and optimized for solar cell and other electronic applications. Regarding solar cell processing, various aspects pertaining to the feasibility of Al2O3 and related technologies are addressed. For instance, the thermal stability of Al2O3-based passivation schemes proved to be adequate. Moreover, films deposited using batch- or spatial ALD methods—specifically designed by a number of companies to meet the throughput requirements for PV manufacturing—were shown to exhibit similar properties as obtained by single-wafer laboratory reactors. In addition, a pulsed-precursor PECVD process is reported as an alternative method for the fast deposition of Al2O3 and other materials. The development and understanding of Al2O3-based surface passivation schemes in conjunction with the new ways of investigating, controlling and manipulating their properties, as outlined in this thesis, are important for the ongoing developments in the field of photovoltaics aiming at higher efficiencies and lower costs per kilowatt-hour. Based on the recent announcements about enhanced efficiencies for industrial-type rear-passivated solar cells and the installation of high-throughput deposition systems for Al2O3 in solar cell pilot lines, it is expected that Al2O3-based surface passivation schemes will provide a leap in performance of a large share of commercially available solar modules in the coming years. In a broader context, the relevance of this thesis may extend to the field of (nano-)electronics in which the continuous reduction of device dimensions demands even more stringent requirements of thin film technology. Extrapolating the rapid developments in recent years, it is expected that ALD will play an increasingly important role for Si-based, but probably also other, photovoltaic applications in the near future.",,,,9,"['https://openalex.org/W182638890', 'https://openalex.org/W2774033080', 'https://openalex.org/W3016592430']",Dingemans,,False,

Two approaches were examined in order to make 18-MEA bind tightly to the alkaline-color-treated weathered hair surface. One was to apply 18-MEA as an acid form and the other was to apply 18-MEA as a salt or complex. It was found that the combination of 18-MEA with specific cationic surfactants [stearoxypropyldimethylamine (SPDA) and docosyldimethylamine (DSDA)] makes the alkaline-color-treated weathered hair surface hydrophobic and that its hydrophobicity is maintained even after shampooing. Characterization of adsorbed layers of 18-MEA/SPDA on a mica surface, as a possible hydrophilic surface model, was performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS). The results revealed that 18-MEA/SPDA formed a layer with high wear resistance, with an alkyl chain, the hydrophobic moiety, oriented at an angle of around 25 degrees to the air interface.",international journal of cosmetic science,"['0142-5463', '1467-2494', '1468-2494']",journal,12,"['https://openalex.org/W1982901142', 'https://openalex.org/W2003308963', 'https://openalex.org/W2007007455', 'https://openalex.org/W2014739548', 'https://openalex.org/W2015507364', 'https://openalex.org/W2043706627', 'https://openalex.org/W2062766066', 'https://openalex.org/W2093625965', 'https://openalex.org/W2154418047', 'https://openalex.org/W2247214695', 'https://openalex.org/W2297019269', 'https://openalex.org/W2470294003', 'https://openalex.org/W3022063431', 'https://openalex.org/W4285719527']",Tanamachi,,False,

It is well known that Ti shows a mechanically stable interface towards bone (osseointegration). The good biological properties are due to the beneficial properties of the native oxide (TiO2) that forms on Ti when exposed to oxygen. The native titanium oxide on Ti is usually amorphous and very thin, 2–7 nm [1-3]. In addition to being stable in the physiological environment, titanium oxides increase calcium ion interactions, which are important for protein and subsequent osteoblast adhesion [4]. Enhanced bone bonding can be achieved with bioactive materials that form a stable unit with bone through a spontaneous formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) on their surface. The biomineralized HA layer acts as a bonding layer to the bone and integration at the atomic/molecular scale can develop. For this reason HA is proposed as a suitable coating material to provide stronger early fixation of uncemented prostheses. Although hydroxyapatite coatings on implants showed long-term survival [5], there are concerns about their reliability under loads. Possible ways to overcome this lack of mechanical stability could be by reinforcing the HA with metal oxides such as zirconia and alumina [6]. Apatites, as well as other calcium phosphates (CaPs), can occur in different phases, summarized in Table 1 [7]. Most of them have been studied as biomaterials. The HA naturally occurring in bone is a multi-substituted calcium phosphate, including traces of CO32, F-, Mg2+, Sr2+, Si4+, Zn2+, Li+ etc [8, 9]. These ionic substitutions are considered to play an important role for the formation and properties of bone. Hydroxyapatite coatings can be produced by different methods [10-19]. Early attempts used plasma spraying, which however resulted in coatings with adhesion problems. Attempts have also been made with physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques. Both of these methods suffer from the drawback that they are line-of-sight methods, which means that coating of complex implant geometries is technically difficult.

Moreover, the effect of graphene-coatings on cell adhesion and morphology was examined with fluorescent confocal microscopy. Cells were stained for actin and nuclei, and there were noticeable differences between pristine nitinol samples compared to graphene-coated samples. Total actin expression from rat aortic smooth muscle cells was found using western blot.

The CPFEM considers the behavior of anisotropic crystals using the continuum mechanical FEM. On one side, the atomic structure data simulated by MD defines the interface to AFEM.

The major emphasis is on precursors that have been reported since 2004, which corresponds to a time of major growth in this field. Progress in the development of metal‐organic precursors is documented for the main group, lanthanide, and group 4– 11 elements. In the main group elements, there has been considerable research activity directed toward the identification of strontium and barium precursors, due both to the technological importance of mixed oxide phases and the inherent difficulties in obtaining volatile, stable thermally complexes of these large metal ions. Aluminum, gallium, and indium have also been the subject of intense investigation because of the importance of many phases containing these elements. The group 4 and 5 elements titanium, zirconium, hafnium, niobium, and tantalum have been the subject of considerable precursor development activity because of the importance of several mixed oxide phases and the applications of zirconium oxide and hafnium oxide as high‐permittivity gate materials in microelectronic devices. Growth of metal nitride films of these elements has also been an active area of research for use as barrier materials in microelectronic devices. The deposition of copper and other first‐row transition‐metal films from metal‐organic precursors is driven by the urgent need for copper metalization procedures in microelectronics device manufacturing. The atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth of the noble metals ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, and platinum has been a very active research area. The current state of metal‐organic precursor development is presented for each of these metallic elements.",encyclopedia of inorganic and bioinorganic

Beal, C. Stevens, Thomas A. Baginski, Michael C. Hamilton, Robert N. Dean","Interposer, Equivalent series resistance","Due to increasing speed, density and number of signal paths in integrated circuits, motivations for high density capacitors capable of quickly sourcing large amounts of current have led to many design and fabrication investigations. This work outlines continued efforts to achieve devices which meet these stringent requirements and are compatible with standard silicon fabrication processes as well as silicon interposer technologies. Previous work has been further developed resulting in devices exhibiting greater capacitance values by employing geometries which maximize surface area. The Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of thin layered high K materials, such as Hafnium Oxide, as opposed to previous silicon-dioxide based devices effectively increased the capacitance per unit area of the structures. This paper outlines the design, fabrication, and testing of high density micro-machined embedded capacitors capable of quickly sourcing (i.e. risetimes greater than 100A/nsec) high currents (i.e. greater than 100A). These devices were successfully simulated then tested using a standard ringdown procedure. Generally, the resulting device characterization found during testing stages strongly correlates to the expected simulated device behavior. Subsequent descriptions and design challenges encountered during fabrication, testing and integration of these passive devices are outlined, as well as potential device integration and implementation strategies for use in silicon interposers.

In addition, the feasibility for practical utilization of several studied solid electrolyte materials in 3D all-solid-state lithium ion batteries was investigated. Several inorganic compounds with high ionic conductivity for all solid state lithium ion batteries have been proposed in recent literatures. These are discussed in Chapter 2 in terms of the relationship with the structural features and the lithium ion mobility. The key criteria of high lithium ion mobility in any solid lithium ion conductor are the concentration of the charge carriers and vacancies, the which is the cross sectional area that lithium ion has to pass through, the connectivity of the sites where lithium ions are mobile and the polarizability of the anions. Based on the structural features, the very well known Li0.50L0.50TiO3 (LLT) compound with perovskite-type was modified to increase the bottleneck size by anionic substitution of oxygen by the relatively larger anion, nitrogen, in Chapter 3. The resulting oxynitride compound contains 0.58 atoms of nitrogen in the formula unit and has a higher lattice volume up to 4.4 %. Although it is expected that lithium ions can move more easily in this structure, impedance measurements show that the ionic conductivity is decreasing with increase in nitrogen content. This has been explained by the distortion in TiO6 polyhedra which is slowing down the lithium ion motion. In addition we observed anionic vacancies which are also changing the chemical environment of the lithium. The anionic vacancies which are formed during the substitution can be prevented by cationic substitution of Ti4+ with Ta5+ to combine with anionic substitution in oxygen positions. This type of approach will not only prevent anionic vacancies but will also increase the electro chemical stability of this compound towards possible reduction when in contact with lithium. Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) with garnet type has recently become of high interest due to its potential as a solid-state lithium ion conductor. It has a high ionic conductivity (10- 4 S/cm for the cubic phase at room temperature) as well as a good stability against lithium and moisture. However, LLZO crystallizes in three different phases; low and high temperature cubic and tetragonal. The high temperature cubic phase is preferred because it has a 2 orders of magnitude higher ionic conductivity than the tetragonal phase whereas the synthesis of the cubic phase needs a high calcination temperature which makes it difficult to control the stoichiometry. Recently it has also been found that due to the high calcination temperature, the aluminum contamination from the reaction crucible (Al2O3) enables and stabilizes the cubic phase formation. To have a better control on the chemical composition and prevent contamination, low temperature synthesis by a sol-gel method was investigated in Chapter 4. The tetragonal phase was successfully synthesized at 1073 K. This is 200 K lower than any previously reported results and a new low temperature (973 K) cubic phase was reported for the first time. The ionic conductivities of the tetragonal phase were determined and to be in the same order of magnitude with those of the materials synthesized by conventional solid-state synthesis. Unfortunately, the ionic conductivity of the new cubic phase could not be determined due to the temperature limitation during the densification process which leads porous specimens. Li5La3Ta2O12 (LLTO) and Li6BaLa2Ta2O12 (LLBTO) with garnet type are yet other promising candidates as solid lithium ion conductors. They are chemically stabile against lithium and moisture due to the presence of Ta5+ in the garnet compound series. LLTO has a lithium ionic conductivity of 10-6 S/cm, whereas LLBTO exhibits a conductivity of 10-5 S/cm at room temperature due to its larger unit cell and higher lithium ion concentration. The sol-gel synthesis of garnet compounds was investigated in Chapter 5. It is found that nano-sized compounds have better sintering ability and the ionic conductivities are found in the same order magnitude with a slightly increase compared to the compounds synthesized by conventional solid state methods. The sol-gel synthesis of garnet compounds opened up a new approach in the preparation of solid-state lithium ion conductors with 3D structure. This is discussed in detail in Chapter 6 for the preparation of 3 dimensional ordered macraporous (3DOM) materials. LLTO was investigated for 3DOM material preparation experiments due to the relatively lower synthesis temperature resulting in smaller grain sized compounds compared to other members of garnet compounds. 3DOM membranes of Li5La3Ta2O12 (LLTO) for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries were prepared by using colloidal crystal templating of mono dispersed polystyrene (PS) spheres combined with sol-gel synthesis of LLTO precursor. Two different types of solvent (EtOH and HAc/EG) and 3 different sizes of PS spheres (1, 3 and 5 µm) were used for the preparation of 3DOM membranes. The effect of the solvent type and the PS sphere size on the morphology of the 3DOM membranes was investigated. Our investigations show that using a HAc/EG based solution with the template prepared by using 5 µm PS spheres results in the most interconnected and long range ordered membranes. The 3DOM membranes can be used to fabricate all-solid-state lithium ion batteries using a sandwich structure which is composed of a dense LLTO layer having the 3DOM layer on both sides. Then by immersing the electrode material in the pores of the 3DOM layer, the all-solid-state battery can easily be fabricated. As an alternative 3D structuring method, nano printing by soft lithography is described in Chapter 7. The sol-gel synthesis of Li0.29La0.54TiO3 (LLT) with perovskite and its patterning by soft lithography was studied. A 3D patterned LLT was obtained in the micro molding experiments and for the first time ceramic electrolyte materials were deposited with 3 dimensional structures (line and pit patterns) starting with simple sol-gel synthesis were combined with micro molding experiments by soft lithography. The patterning experiments conducted on Si substrates and\or Pt coated Si substrate. The Si substrate was found to be more suitable and yielded better patterns compared to Pt coated Si substrate because the deposition performed on Pt coated Si substrate yielded unwanted residual layers in both line and pit pattern deposition experiments. This may be explained due to the wetting properties of the Pt surface and the durability of Pt coated Si substrates at 973 K. AFM and SEM measurements were done to investigate the morphology of the patterns deposited by soft lithography and it shows that by using the different type of mold it is possible to replicate the desired structure. In conclusion, sol-gel synthesis is a successful method to prepare various lithium ion battery electrolyte materials at low temperature and it makes use of inexpensive precursors of metal salts (nitrates, acetates or oxides) combined with metal alkoxides. Using sol-gel precursor solutions, we demonstrated the successful preparation of 3D structured electrolyte materials by soft lithography and crystal templating for 3D all solid state lithium ion batteries. We found that the soft lithography is a very accurate technique (sub-micrometer precision) and it can easily be applicable to larger scales. In contrast, the accuracy and the applicability of crystal templating is dependent on the template sphere size and the precursor material. As a follow up research, the studied preparation techniques (such as crystal templating and micro patterning) can be combined with impregnation of the electrode material by previously investigated deposition techniques such as; spin-coating, atomic layer deposition (ALD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The micro patterning experiments can easily be used for any type of material which can be prepared by sol-gel synthesis. Since the sol-gel synthesis of active electrode materials was established in literature, 3D all-solid-state lithium ion battery can be easily prepared by deposition of different array of compounds separately on the same substrate. It is also possible with non-oxidic compounds which could be generated by changing from an air atmosphere to different (N2, NH3, H2, etc.) atmospheres during the high-temperature step of the synthesis. Overall, the combination of rather low tech and low-cost processes (sol-gel combined with soft-lithography or crystal templating) using simple starting materials and equipment (vacuum pump and heater plate) makes it possible to create sub-micrometer structures of electrolyte materials in the normal lab environment. It is likely that this manufacturing route can be applied to various other battery materials as well as large scales.",,,,7,['https://openalex.org/W2124900558'],Kokal,,False,

Kuzmichev, Leonid Tsybulsky","Physical vapor deposition, Deposition","Induction heating is widely used in different fields due to high process productivity and universality, cleanness and possibility of full automation. This process is friendly for environment. Since the induction allows reaching temperatures of 2000 °C and more, this method is very suitable for evaporation. This process is known to be a process of emitting atoms or molecules by hot matter surface. The atoms or molecules form “the vapor”. Since vapor pressure depends on temperature, the latter is conditionally accepted as “the evaporation temperature” when pressure of saturated vapor reaches 1 Pa. Data on evaporation temperatures are collected in numerous handbooks, e.g. (Banshah, 1994). The evaporation is a very important process for industrial production and scientific researches. Its main application is deposition of thin film layers and coatings on semiconductors, glass and polymers in electronics and optics as well as on other industrial products including food packaging films, metal strips, etc. The evaporation is mostly related with technology of Physical Vapor Deposition (shortly, PVD) that means matter deposition from vapor or atomic/molecular medium. In PVD, the vapor medium, as a source of depositing matter, is generated physically (not chemically!) due to thermal evaporation of some primary source materials; deposition, in turn, must happen as atom-by-atom process, at least as multi-atom cluster process but without any drops or even smallest droplets. There are various evaporation methods for PVD except induction: evaporation from boats and crucibles with resistive (Joule) or radiation heating, evaporation with electron and laser beam heating, cathode arc evaporation, etc. The induction technology competes with the mentioned methods and occupies own niche in industrial technology and for preparation of scientific objects. The evaporation also is a very useful process for refining materials to obtain high purity, for producing microand nanoparticles and, thus, it is a base of so-called evaporation metallurgy. The main features and fundamental possibilities of the evaporating induction technology are the followings: electromagnetic induction may provide not only heating evaporated materials but also vapor ionization and high density vapor plasma generation for Ion-Plasma Enhanced (Activated, Assisted) PVD processes, often called as the Ion Plating, accompanied by self-ion bombardment for obtaining high quality coatings;",intech ebooks,,ebook platform,9,"['https://openalex.org/W1552844297', 'https://openalex.org/W1625423361', 'https://openalex.org/W1966221997', 'https://openalex.org/W2052766315', 'https://openalex.org/W2093914075', 'https://openalex.org/W2227434730', 'https://openalex.org/W2243088594', 'https://openalex.org/W2406377390', 'https://openalex.org/W324281765', 'https://openalex.org/W4246726772', 'https://openalex.org/W4301927756', 'https://openalex.org/W618316255', 'https://openalex.org/W839958197']",Kuzmichev,,False,

Due to the fact that electrochemical deposition is an atomic/molecular level process, the formed layer entirely takes the three-dimensional shape of the substrate with a very high accuracy. As a result of the last years scientific progress, the theoretical aspects of electrochemical engineering principles applicable for electrochemical micro-processing have significantly developed so that, associated with performance techniques and equipment lead to the new and innovative materials development having controlled microor nanostructures. In spite of a long history and experience, the metals surface finishing industry still has not been successful in extending the range of the metals able to be electrodeposited towards some of them with a promising technical potential, such as Al, W, Mo, Ti. Their capability to form stable oxides represents an obstacle against their application as coating layers, especially from classical aqueous electrolytes.

The high mobility characteristics of InAlN/GaN and InAlN/AlN/GaN materials are ascribed to the fact that the 2DEG has a comparatively low sheet density (1.61013-1.81013 cm-2), the alloy disorder scattering is weakened in the high-quality InAlN crystal since its compositions are evenly distributed, and the interface roughness scattering is alleviated at the smooth interface where the 2DEG is located.",acta physica sinica,['1000-3290'],journal,6,"['https://openalex.org/W1608258725', 'https://openalex.org/W1964322230', 'https://openalex.org/W1976513495', 'https://openalex.org/W1986530027', 'https://openalex.org/W1986991032', 'https://openalex.org/W2019188879', 'https://openalex.org/W2030793208', 'https://openalex.org/W2044229689', 'https://openalex.org/W2049606833', 'https://openalex.org/W2058717737', 'https://openalex.org/W2063354978', 'https://openalex.org/W2082994109', 'https://openalex.org/W2085803222', 'https://openalex.org/W2088545405', 'https://openalex.org/W2088906655', 'https://openalex.org/W2100883406', 'https://openalex.org/W2164782746', 'https://openalex.org/W2167800447', 'https://openalex.org/W2250334911']",Zhang,,False,

Structurally, graphene is free of defects, with all the carbon atoms linked together by strong and flexible bonds. This has made graphene to have unusual electronic, optical, mechanical and thermal properties. The outstanding properties of graphene reported so far includes Young’s modulus (~1100Gpa), fracture strength (125 Gpa), high thermal conductivity (~ 5000 W m-1K-1), quantum Hall effect at room temperature [2–4], an ambipolar electric field effect along with ballistic conduction of charge carriers [5], tunable band gap and so on. Many efforts have been made on the preparation of the graphene via a number of physical and chemical methods. Some of these methods provides high quality graphene and has opened up new possible routes to address the challenges in preparation and molecular engineering of high quality processable graphene at low cost and large scale [4]. In spite of this progress, the standard procedure to make the high quality graphene is micromechanical cleavage method, which is suitable for only fundamental studies [3]. Alternatively, selective epitaxial growth of graphene on metal or nonmetal substrates using chemical vapor deposition or by thermal decomposition of SiC was developed [6]. The graphene-type carbon materials have been produced by substrate free CVD and radio-frequency plasma-enhanced CVD and so on [7]. On the other hand, the chemical routes are widely considered as a promising approach for large scale production [8]. This approach provides processable graphene, that can be easily cast into various structures or integrate graphene with other materials to form nanocomposites [8, 9]. Currently, there are two most popular chemical approaches to obtain graphene: dispersion and exfoliation of graphite/graphene oxide/graphite intercalation compounds and its reduction after exfoliation or direct exfoliation without chemical modification in suitable organic solvents or surfactants [8]. Unlike the direct exfoliation approach, the chemical modification method results in considerable destruction of graphene electronic structure, thus compromising its unique properties [10, 11]. In addition, these methods involve several steps and need 3-5 days to allow the intercalants and organic solvents to fully insert into the graphitic layers [12]. In contrast to this oxidation and reduction method, some people have developed direct graphite exfoliation method using suitable organic solvent. A high quality single layer graphene sheets (GS) have been prepared by the chemical solution process in which graphite was directly exfoliated in an organic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP)",intech ebooks,,ebook platform,8,['https://openalex.org/W2001618763'],Rangappa,,False,

Perform high temperature fission product release tests on a subset of particles in order to calibrate the collection efficiency of the Core Conduction Cooldown Test Facility (CCCTF) deposition cup for selected fission products. Gamma count particles before and after the heating test to quantify the released fission product fractions. 7. Archive remaining particles for later use.

Microcrystalline silicon is extensively used as absorber layer in thin-film tandem solar cells, combining the advantages of a low (indirect) band gap (1.1 eV), which results in an enhanced absorption of red and (near) infrared light, with an improved stability under light exposure (reduced Staebler–Wronski effect). However, due to the indirect nature of the band gap, relatively thick (1–2 µm) µc-Si:H films are necessary to achieve an efficient absorption of red and (near) infrared light, even when light trapping concepts are applied. Therefore, from a cost-perspective point of view, high growth rates (>1 nm/s) are required, preferably in combination with large-area (roll-to-roll) processing. The most common, and so far most successful, deposition technique is the capacitively-coupled plasma (CCP) in parallel plate configuration using radio or very high excitation frequencies (RF or VHF, respectively) and highly hydrogen diluted hydrogen and silane gas mixtures. Approaches to increase the growth rate include an increase of the plasma power, moving from a low-pressure to a high-pressure depletion (LPD to HPD, respectively) regime, and/or by increasing the excitation frequency from 13.56 MHz to 27–300 MHz. The combination of HPD-VHF has resulted in high deposition rates (2-3 nm/s) while maintaining high solar cell efficiencies (7-8%). In this work, the use of an ultra-fast (2-20 nm/s) deposition technique, i.e. the expanding thermal plasma, has been explored for the deposition of µc-Si:H films. Characteristic for ETP-grown µc-Si:H films is the lack of a sufficient amount of a-Si:H tissue, which is necessary to passivate the grain boundaries and fill the intergranular space, resulting in a network of (inter-connected) cracks and voids. As a consequence, the µc-Si:H films are prone to post-deposition oxidation, resulting in low solar cells efficiencies (<2%). The post-deposition oxidation has been monitored by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy over a period of 8 months. This study revealed a two-timescale oxidation: on short timescales (<3 months) the crystalline silicon grain boundaries oxidize, on longer timescales the oxidation involves also the a-Si:H tissue. This indicates that in order to prevent post-deposition oxidation, it is not sufficient to fill the intergranular space, but that the a-Si:H tissue needs to be of sufficient quality, i.e. dense and not susceptible for post-deposition oxidation. One process that could be responsible for the insufficient amount of a-Si:H tissue, is hydrogen-induced etching of a-Si:H tissue. Atomic hydrogen is, under µc-Si:H growth conditions, abundant in the plasma, and is known to preferentially etch a-Si:H over crystalline silicon (c-Si). In addition, the interaction of atomic hydrogen with the (growing) film can result in the formation of an hydrogen-rich sub-surface layer, caused by the insertion of atomic hydrogen into strained Si-Si bonds, which possibly explains the porous quality of the a-Si:H tissue. Monitoring the etch rate of a-Si:H films during Ar/H2 plasma exposure by real time spectroscopic ellipsometry showed that the hydrogen-induced etch rate was at least one order of magnitude lower than typical deposition rates. In addition, FTIR spectroscopy revealed that insertion of atomic H in the sub-surface layer (top ~30 nm) during Ar/H2 plasma exposure did not result in an increased porosity. These results suggest that the interaction of atomic hydrogen with the growing film is not responsible for the insufficient amount of (dense) a-Si:H tissue. The fact that the interaction of atomic hydrogen is not responsible for the poor material properties of ETP-grown µc-Si:H, the question what mechanism is then responsible? arises. To address this question the plasma chemistry and the resulting growth mechanism of ETP is compared to CCP, which so far is the only technique with which solar-grade µc-Si:H is obtained. One difference between the two techniques is the absence of an ion bombardment effect in ETP. In CCP the HPD and the use of VHF are employed to suppress a (potentially uncontrolled) ion bombardment effect, hypothesized to be responsible for an amorphization of the crystalline growth and defect incorporation. However, there is always some form of ion bombardment present. The extent to which ions contribute to the growth depends on the ion flux, the ion energy, and the chemical nature of the ion. Under HPD-VHF conditions SinHm+ is identified as the dominant ion in H2/SiH4 plasmas, but no direct ion energy and ion flux measurements under HPD conditions have been reported so far. Therefore, the ion energy and flux in a CCP reactor have been studied. For this purpose, a capacitively-coupled plasma reactor in parallel plate configuration has been designed and built, in close collaboration with the Institute of Photovoltaics at Forschungszentrum Julich (Germany). This reactor has been especially designed for the implementation of plasma and (in situ) film diagnostics. Under solar-grade µc-Si:H deposition conditions the contribution of ions to the film growth has been studied by means of a capacitive probe. The ion to Si deposition flux ratio was found to be large, ~0.30. However, since the ion energy is rather low,",,,,2,[],Bronneberg,,False,

Hojou",Deposition,"A couple of ion-induced processes are applied to fabricate a highly crystalline film of semiconducting silicide, β-FeSi2 on a Si substrate. One is the sputter deposition process, in which 35 keV Ar+ ions are utilized to deposit sputtered iron (Fe) on Si substrate to form β-FeSi2 in the temperature range around 973 K by means of ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD) method. The other is the sputter etching (SE) of the substrate surface prior to deposition, which plays a critical role in determining the crystalline properties of β-FeSi2 films. Authors have shown that when the SE conditions are properly chosen, continuous and relatively homogeneous β-FeSi2 thin films with high crystal orientation are fabricated with IBSD method in the temperature range of 873-973 K, with the film thickness of 50-100 nm. In addition, the interface is fairly smooth, where the transition layer at the interface is limited to a few atomic layers. Although care was taken to minimize the defect concentration in the obtained films, even the most highly-oriented β-FeSi2 films contain a small amount of defects. To make the defect concentration as low as possible, SE treatment was performed at lower incident energies.

SQUIDs are used for ultrasensitive electric and magnetic measurements of all physical quantities that can be converted into magnetic flux, for example, magnetic field, magnetic field gradients, current, voltage, displacement, magnetic susceptibility etc. SQUIDs serve as extremely sensitive magnetic field sensors for biomagnetic measurements, geomagnetic survey, non-destructive evaluation, low-noise preamplifiers, picovoltmeters, etc. (see, e.g., Kleiner et al., 2004;Clarke & Braginski, 2006;Fagaly, 2006).It is important that the SQUID magnetometers measure vector components of magnetic fields.In addition, they can measure (in hardware!)spatial gradients of magnetic fields; they are able to resolve tiny changes (~1 fT) in large (~ 1 µT) signals, and have a white noise spectrum in a wide frequency range (1 Hz -10 MHz).No other magnetic field sensor has this combination of properties, which are especially important for, e.g., biomagnetic applications.Biomagnetic www.intechopen.comApplications of High-Tc Superconductivity 148 applications demand a very challenging tasks of measurements of tiny magnetic fields generated by very weak ionic currents in biological neural networks and the real time inverse calculations for the localization of these ionic currents.High-T c superconductors have significant potential for further developments in fundamental physics and applications (Faley, 2010c).Increased interest in the high-T c superconducting devices is spurred by the expected up to 30-fold price increase for liquid helium due to a drastic shortage of reserves (Witchalls, 2010).This will impact, first of all, the biomagnetic applications of low-T c DC SQUIDs, for example, for magnetoencephalography (MEG), where the implementation of cryocoolers can ruin the sensitivity of measurement systems.The high-T c SQUIDs demonstrate low noise properties up to the temperatures of about 80 K, which can be easily reached with cheap liquid nitrogen.Most of the presently available high-T c SQUIDs are optimized for operation at a temperature 77 K, at which the equilibrium vapour pressure of liquid nitrogen coincides with atmospheric pressure.Replacement of low-T c SQUIDs with high-T c SQUIDs in future MEG systems would make the MEG systems independent of helium supplies, much more user-friendly, and would save up to about €100,000.-peryear in operating costs per multichannel MEG system thus stimulating general acceptance of the MEG systems for clinical use.Liquid nitrogen is about ten times cheaper than liquid 4 He and can be easily obtained from air.It is also sufficient to replenish the liquid nitrogen in standard cryostats for MEG only about once a month and this can be done simply through a long nonmagnetic silicone tube from a stationary tank placed outside the magnetically shielded room.The optional cycle refrigeration recondensing the cryogen between measurements would be also much cheaper and simpler in the case of the high-T c MEG system compared to the low-T c system.Also in the case of measurements of the currents of high-energy heavy-ion beams in the radioisotope beam accelerators, the implementation of high-T c SQUID systems can save operating costs of about $150,000 per year for each system compared to the low-T c SQUID systems (Watanabe et al., 2010).An important prerequisite for the application of high-T c SQUIDs for MEG systems is magnetic field resolution better than 10 fT/√Hz down to frequencies of few Hz at 77 K.Such sensitivity of high-T c SQUIDs has been achieved by a number of groups using superconducting multilayer flux transformers with a multiturn input coil for optimal coupling of the magnetic field to be measured to the high-T c DC SQUID loop (Dantsker et al., 1995) (Drung et al., 1996) (Faley et al., 2001, 2006b).Reduction of the excess low frequency noise of the multilayer high-T c DC SQUID magnetometers is crucial for applications.This can be achieved only with the highest degree of crystalline perfection and stoichiometry of the high-T c superconducting thin films in the multilayer heterostructures.The choice of the proper deposition method and deposition conditions as well as the technologically compatible materials for substrates and oxide heterostructures is important for providing the best possible epitaxial growth of all films involved (Faley et al., 2006b).Influences of lattice mismatch and difference in thermal expansion coefficients of the materials in the epitaxial oxide heterostructures should be minimized because they lead to strains inside the high-T c superconducting films and deteriorate their properties (Faley et al., 2006a).Patterning techniques as well as proper layouts and capsulations are also essential for the total sensitivity of the high-T c DC SQUID sensors to be optimised for particular applications.In this chapter the technological aspects and physical properties of epitaxial oxide heterostructures are described, which are used for the preparation of high-T c DC SQUID www.intechopen.comEpitaxial Oxide Heterostructures for Ultimate High-Tc Quantum Interferometers 149 flip-chip magnetometers with multilayer flux transformers having magnetic field sensitivity below 10 fT/√Hz.Deposition and structuring are outlined for the epitaxial oxide heterostructures; materials for substrates, epitaxial bilayer buffer, Josephson junctions and multilayer flux transformers; the ramp-type and bicrystal Josephson junctions; operation features, layouts, and properties of the all-oxide epitaxial multilayer high-T c DC SQUID sensors including their encapsulation. Deposition of epitaxial metal-oxide heterostructuresSignificant technological efforts are required to produce high-quality samples of superconducting cuprates due to their sensitivity to the compositional and structural inhomogeneities.Accurate stoichiometry, high degree of crystallization in a single phase and proper oxidation of the film are essential.For the deposition of epitaxial YBCO films it is also important to have an appropriate substrate temperature and definite partial oxygen pressure.The required purity of c-axis orientation and 123 phase of the YBCO-films is determined by the position of the sputtering conditions in the P O2 -T phase diagram of YBCO.The best YBCO films are obtained along the line in the P O2 -T phase diagram (Hammond & Bormann, 1989) associated with initial oxygen content O 6 , which corresponds to the absence of oxygen in the plane of the CuO chains and the CuO 2 planes of YBCO are undoped.Three reproducible deposition methods for the fabrication of thin-film metaloxide heterostructures fulfilling such conditions are now mainly used: pulsed laser deposition, reactive co-evaporation, and the high oxygen pressure magnetron sputtering technique.These methods are briefly reviewed below with the emphasis on the high oxygen pressure magnetron sputtering technique, which we preferentially employ for preparation of SQUID sensors.The reactive co-evaporation method was adopted for YBCO films by Kinder and co-workers (Prusseit et al., 2000).By rapid cycling between deposition and oxygen reaction they combined deposition in a high vacuum environment and oxygenation at a differentially high oxygen pressure enclosed in the heater.The reactive co-evaporation method is especially effective for the commercial large-scale production of epitaxial cuprate films on large wafers or on tapes intended for high current applications such as cables for transmission power lines, generators, and motors.The reactive co-evaporation method provides very high material utilization efficiency, high deposition rate, possibility of continuous deposition on km-long tapes, enabling easy switching between many elements, and fine adjustment of the composition.One of the disadvantages of the reactive coevaporation method is the necessity of continuous rate control for each element of the compounds.An atomic absorption monitor can be used for continuous measurement of the vapour densities near to the substrates (Matias et al., 2010).The standard apparatus for reactive co-evaporation is relatively expensive with respect to initial investments and maintenance.Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is the most widely used method for the deposition of metaloxide heterostructures.The material that is to be deposited is vaporized from the target by a pulsed laser beam and transported in a plasma plume to a substrate.This process can be performed in the presence of oxygen as a background gas to oxygenate the deposited metaloxide films.The physical phenomena of laser-target interaction and film growth are quite complex.The energy of the laser pulse is first converted into electronic excitation and then into thermal, chemical and mechanical energy resulting in plasma formation, evaporation, www.intechopen.com",intech ebooks,,ebook platform,5,"['https://openalex.org/W1524819733', 'https://openalex.org/W1549475994',

Ogino, Takahiro Tsukamoto","Exfoliation joint, Graphene foam, Electron Mobility","Graphene is a two-dimensional material with hexagonal carbon network, and multilayer of graphene has been well-known as graphite. In 2004, it was reported that single-layer graphene can be exfoliated from graphite and observed using an optical microscope when a graphene sheet is attached on a 300 nm-thick SiO2/Si wafer (Novoselov et al., 2004). Graphene exhibits an extremely high mobility, 200,000 cm2/Vs, which is 200 times as fast as that of Si. This high mobility was theoretically expected and then a mobility of 230,000 cm2/Vs was experimentally observed in a suspended graphene sheet (Bolotin et al., 2008). Since the sp2 bonding of carbon is very strong, a mechanically and chemically stable twodimensional network with few defects is realized in spite of an expectation that an atomic layer would be intrinsically unstable (Stolyarova et al., 2007). Owing to the small weight of carbon atom and the strong bonding between the atoms, thermal conductivity of graphene is in the highest group in the materials (Balandin et al., 2008). These features are effectively utilized when graphene is applied to electronic devices. Up to now, many reports have shown that graphene electronics is very promising for post-Si devices, but serious problems are also pointed out. For example, compatibility of high-quality graphene and wafer-scale processing is a big challenge. Although high-quality graphene can be obtained by exfoliation of graphene flakes from graphite, its size is small and the position control is almost impossible. Wafer-scale preparation of graphene sheets and their processing can be realized by epitaxial graphene on SiC (Berger, et al., 2004), chemical vapour deposition of graphene on a metal substrate (Sutter et al., 2008; Bae et al., 2010; Li et al., 2009), or coating of graphene oxide (Eda et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008). However, the quality of those graphene is not sufficient for high-performance devices. In this article, we show our recent results about substrate engineering toward graphene integrated devices. We first describe properties and features of graphene on solid surfaces and then show strategy about etching of graphene, where “etching” is used for cutting of graphene sheets through chemical reactions. Based on this background, we show our experimental results about tight attachment of graphene onto oxide substrates, such as sapphire and titania, and characterize the interface properties between the graphene sheet and the substrate surface. Finally, we show processing of graphene sheets attached on the sapphire surfaces using the atomic structures on the substrate surface as templates. Here, we would like to emphasize that the interface properties between the graphene sheet and the substrate is particularly important and that etching and local properties of the graphene",intech ebooks,,ebook platform,2,"['https://openalex.org/W1573844195', 'https://openalex.org/W1646294624', 'https://openalex.org/W1965040189', 'https://openalex.org/W1965730373', 'https://openalex.org/W1978325183', 'https://openalex.org/W1984885233', 'https://openalex.org/W1985167115', 'https://openalex.org/W1991859775', 'https://openalex.org/W1997309206', 'https://openalex.org/W1998557451', 'https://openalex.org/W2008114223', 'https://openalex.org/W2010196525', 'https://openalex.org/W2012618050', 'https://openalex.org/W2016434164', 'https://openalex.org/W2018858346', 'https://openalex.org/W2020962395', 'https://openalex.org/W2021162720', 'https://openalex.org/W2022145612', 'https://openalex.org/W2025516544', 'https://openalex.org/W2040458243', 'https://openalex.org/W2058122340', 'https://openalex.org/W2069611198', 'https://openalex.org/W2071615104', 'https://openalex.org/W2073861147', 'https://openalex.org/W2077783523', 'https://openalex.org/W2078792724', 'https://openalex.org/W2087831582', 'https://openalex.org/W2087989163', 'https://openalex.org/W2092188263', 'https://openalex.org/W2093398373', 'https://openalex.org/W2097773259', 'https://openalex.org/W2101312334', 'https://openalex.org/W2103707735', 'https://openalex.org/W2105966178', 'https://openalex.org/W2114351820', 'https://openalex.org/W2119882629', 'https://openalex.org/W2121772044', 'https://openalex.org/W2123070389', 'https://openalex.org/W2132221775', 'https://openalex.org/W2146564548', 'https://openalex.org/W2148144129', 'https://openalex.org/W2149032140', 'https://openalex.org/W2149070465', 'https://openalex.org/W2163040382', 'https://openalex.org/W2169580059', 'https://openalex.org/W2949564085', 'https://openalex.org/W3103394764']",Ogino,,False,

In Chapter 3, the HfO2/La2O3/p-Ge and n-Ge stacks were deposited as gate dielectric to discuss the effect on material and electrical properties of different La2O3 ratio in fixed thickness. It shows that insertion of a La2O3 layer at the HfO2/Ge interface improves the interfacial and electrical properties of HfO2/Ge MOS devices. Moreover, we fabricated thin HfO2/La2O3/Ge devices for scaling down the EOT. The lowest EOT we achieved is down to 1.08 nm while thickness reduces to about 4 nm. In Chapter 4, in-situ N2/H2/Ar plasma surface-nitridation treatment on p-type Ge (100) with HfO2/La2O3 high-κ gate oxide was investigated by remote rf plasma on radical-assisted atomic layer deposition (RAALD). The interfacial LaGeOxNy formation and Ge outdiffusion were also investigated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The high-κ MOS device with an ultrathin LaGeOxNy interlayer shows good electrical characteristics, including larger κ value, smaller equivalent oxide thickness, lower leakage current density, smaller C-V hysteresis, and lower interface-state density. The involved mechanism lies in that the LaGeOxNy interlayer can effectively block the diffusion of Ge, thus improving the high-κ films/Ge interface quality. In Chapter 5, we fabricated 8 nm thick TiO2-Al2O3-La2O3 stack structure with different arrangement to investigate the oxide location effect the Ge MOSCAPs properties. The location of high-κ layers were accurately controlled by atomic layer deposition (ALD). From the results, we found that the La2O3 be the contact layer with Ge substrate, Al2O3 be the blocking layer to suppress the Ge outdiffusion and TiO2 be the higher-κ layer on the top to reduce the EOT. In this arrangement, we could take all advantages of high-κ oxides and get the best electrical properties. Finally, in Chapter 6, we fabricate cyclic D2O plasma treatments on HfO2 films and surface D2O plasma treatment on p- Ge (100) substrate by radical-assisted atomic layer deposition (RAALD). The samples with cyclic and surface D2O plasma treatments show better electrical properties than the sample without treatment, because of higher quality of HfO2 films and better surface quality. It shows higher capacitance density, lower equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) and lower leakage current density, respectively. The mechanism lies in that D2O radical pre-treatment remove native oxide and D2O chemisorption sites to form better surface quality. On the other hand, in-situ cyclic D2O radical anneal could form purer and denser HfO2 to suppress Ge diffusion through HfO2 films.",清華大學材料科學工程學系學位論文,,journal,0,[],林民和,,False,

Dyer, George R. Darling, John B. Claridge, Matthew J. Rosseinsky",,"Abgegrenzt: Die verborgenen Phasengrenzflächen in Heterostrukturen, die durch sequenzielles Abscheiden von nanoskopisch kleinen Y2O3:ZrO2(YSZ)- und SrTiO3(STO)-Einheiten erhalten wurden, sind entscheidend für die Eigenschaften dieser Materialien. Mit DFT-Rechnungen wurde gezeigt, dass in diesen Heterostrukturen Phasengrenzflächen rekonstruiert werden müssen, um die bevorzugte Struktur zu erhalten (siehe Bild). Deposition of nanosized layers of two different metal oxides upon one another produces layered heterostructures with a wide range of new physical properties.1 For example, a conducting two-dimensional electron gas was discovered at the interface between the two insulators LaAlO3 and SrTiO3.2 The atomic arrangements within heterostructures of complex functional oxides determine the resulting properties and are not necessarily straightforward to construct based on the bulk crystal structures of the independent components. García-Barriocanal et al. reported that an epitaxial heterostructure of nanometer-sized layers of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) and [001]-oriented SrTiO3 (STO) has an up to eight orders of magnitude higher conductivity than bulk YSZ at room temperature.3 YSZ is a commonly used electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) run at high temperatures (>800 °C), and such an increase in ionic conductivity at lower temperatures would be expected to have a substantial impact on the performance of SOFCs.4 However, considerable discussion has followed the original publication, with the suggestion that the increased conductivity may be partly electronic in origin.5 The possibility remains that the conductivity is entirely ionic6 with indications that the increased conductivity arises from disorder in the oxygen lattice induced in the YSZ layers.7, 8 Similar, though smaller, increases in conductivity have been found for other layered oxide heterostructures.9 The exact atomic structure of the YSZ-STO heterostructures remains undetermined. Knowledge of the structure at the boundary between the two component oxide units is crucial for understanding the increase in conductivity, which has been assigned to reconstruction at this interface within the structure.3 It is difficult to probe the structure of interfaces within thin films experimentally, and previous attempts for YSZ-STO films seem inconsistent. The relative orientation of the YSZ and STO regions has been determined by X-ray diffraction10 and scanning transmission electron microscopy,3, 8 with YSZ rotated by 45° about the [001] axis relative to STO. However, electron energy loss spectroscopy suggests that the STO is terminated with a TiO2 layer3 in layered YSZ-STO, whereas experimental attempts to grow YSZ on STO substrates with different terminations show that [001]-oriented YSZ can only be reliably grown epitaxially on SrO-terminated STO,10 leaving the preferred termination of the STO in question. Previous calculations, carried out using only TiO2-terminated STO,7 determined that oxide ions in the first YSZ layer adopted positions completing the TiO6 octahedra. We assess the stability and electronic structure of different possible atomic arrangements in the YSZ/STO heterostructure using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, focussing on reconstruction at the repeating boundaries between the component YSZ and STO units. We find that the most stable structures, and those which correspond to known oxide crystal chemistry, are not obtained by taking bulk terminations of the YSZ and STO crystals. Instead taking a rock-salt ordered ZrO termination of YSZ gives stable structures with coordination environments which are consistent with known crystal structures, while maintaining insulating electronic behavior and correct YSZ stoichiometry. We have chosen to use DFT calculations, unlike recent classical force field calculations of heterostructures containing YSZ.11 Although DFT calculations are limited to smaller cells than those used in classical simulations, and are therefore not able to investigate the micrometer scale, they are more transferable than force fields. This is desirable for our structural investigation, since atoms in heterostructures are likely to be in coordination environments different from the constituent bulk phases. Additionally, DFT calculations allow for flexibility in the oxidation state of atoms, and for the calculation of the electronic properties of heterostructures. The simplest model for the buried interfaces within layered heterostructures of two materials is to use terminations of their bulk crystal structures at the interfaces. The two possible terminations in the [001] direction for each of the STO (perovskite) and YSZ (fluorite) crystal structures are shown in Figure 1: STO terminates with either SrO layers or TiO2 layers (both neutral), and YSZ with either Zr or O2 layers (both charged: neglecting Y atoms and O vacancies). This yields four possible interfaces (Figure 2): A) Zr-terminated YSZ and TiO2-terminated STO, B) Zr-terminated YSZ and SrO-terminated STO, C) O2-terminated YSZ and TiO2-terminated STO, and D) O2-terminated YSZ and SrO-terminated STO. a) The perovskite crystal structure and b) the SrO- and c) TiO2-terminations of SrTiO3 in the [001] plane. d) The fluorite crystal structure and e) the Zr- and f) O-terminations of cubic ZrO2 in the [001] plane. The fluorite unit cell has been rotated by 45° in (e) and (f) to aid comparison with the perovskite terminations in (b) and (c) and consists of sequential charged Zr4+ and O24− layers. The ZrO termination of ZrO2 used to construct models E and F has the same structure as (b), where Sr is replaced with Zr. Ti atoms are at the center of the gray polyhedra, other atoms are colored as follows: Sr mid-gray, Zr light gray, and O dark gray. Structural diagrams of the heterostructures formed using A) Zr-terminated YSZ and TiO2-terminated SrTiO3, B) Zr-terminated YSZ and SrO-terminated SrTiO3, C) O2-terminated YSZ and TiO2-terminated SrTiO3, and D) O2-terminated YSZ and SrO-terminated SrTiO3. Each structure is viewed along one of the short lattice vectors. Ti atoms are at the center of the gray polyhedra, other atoms are colored as follows: Sr mid-gray, Zr light gray, Y dark gray, and O black. Open arrows indicate five-fold coordinated Zr atoms at the interfaces between the STO and YSZ components. Down arrows indicate OO bonds. A and C with TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 have non-octahedrally coordinated TiO. The construction of heterostructures containing each of these four interfaces is described in detail in the Supporting Information. We used symmetric blocks of STO and YSZ, with the same termination at each end, giving heterostructures with two equivalent interfaces. This is in agreement with experiments, which show no difference between interfaces on either side of YSZ/STO layers.3, 8 The correct choice of symmetric block is essential to obtain chemically reasonable models. The YSZ block was constructed according to the results of previous calculations.12 Both STO and YSZ blocks do not have the overall composition of their bulk phases, since the terminating layer is inevitably present in excess. The STO and YSZ blocks are 1–2 nm thick. Experimentally layered heterostructures have been grown with 1 nm thick YSZ layers and 10 nm thick STO.3 As 10 nm thick STO blocks are computationally infeasible at the level of theory used here, and the centers of the computational STO blocks already resemble bulk STO (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information), we consider our structures to be good approximations of the structures of experimental materials. Geometry optimization of each heterostructure was performed using periodic DFT,13 and as an indication of the relative stability of each heterostructure, a heat of formation was calculated with respect to the binary oxides, as described in the Supporting Information. The lowest energy structure for each of the four heterostructures, A–D, is shown in Figure 2. The calculated energies were 26.3, 27.1, −0.5, and −5.1 eV for A–D, respectively, with lower values representing more stable structures. Structures A and B, with Zr-terminated YSZ blocks, are clearly unstable. The Zr(Y) and O2 layers of YSZ are formally charged, whereas the SrO and TiO2 layers of STO are charge neutral. As a result, the symmetric blocks of YSZ built with bulk terminations are formally charged. With Zr-terminated blocks, the additional layer of Zr atoms gives a composition of [Y2O3][ZrO2]14Zr4 for the YSZ block, with four excess Zr4+ ions. The calculations impose charge neutrality within the super-cells, which therefore have more electrons than expected for the ions Sr2+, Ti4+, Y3+, Zr4+, and O2−. Plots of the partial density of states (PDOS) of A and B (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) show that the excess electrons populate Zr states within the band gap, and begin to fill the Ti-dominated conduction band. This reduction of Zr4+ and Ti4+ to Zr3+ and Ti3+ is clearly energetically expensive, leading to the instability of these models. The interfaces within A and B also suggest energetically unstable structures. The Ti octahedra terminating the STO block in A (Figure 2 A) are clearly distorted, in some the Ti atom is only five-fold coordinated, in a square-pyramidal geometry. The Zr atoms at the interface in B are similarly under-coordinated with most only bonded to five O atoms (Figure 2 B). To our knowledge five-coordinate Zr is unknown in oxide crystal structures. In contrast, structures C and D, are constructed using O2-terminated YSZ blocks. These structures represent most closely those proposed in earlier experimental studies. García-Barriocanal et al.3 proposed TiO2-terminated STO and O2-terminated YSZ, similar to structure C. Structure D, with SrO-terminated STO and O2-terminated YSZ, is effectively that proposed by Cavallaro et al.10 with an interface region resembling SrZrO3. Both models have YSZ blocks with composition [Y2O3][ZrO2]18O8. Considering the expected oxidation states of all the ions, the eight excess O atoms result in electron deficient charge-neutral super-cells. However the plots of the partial density of states (PDOS, Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) do not show unoccupied states at the top of the valence band as might be expected. Instead OO bonding is present in the relaxed structures of C and D. Structure C contains eight OO bonds of lengths 1.4–1.5 Å in the interface region, causing over coordination of Ti atoms, evident in Figure 2. This OO bonding completely accounts for the electron deficiency in the super-cell. Similarly, structure D contains six OO bonds of 1.5 Å length, with an extra O in the Zr layers closest to the interface. Again, this largely accounts for the electron deficiency in the super-cell, however with only six and not eight OO bonds, the valence band is now partially occupied (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). No other structure presented herein contained O–O distances shorter than 2 Å. Using symmetrical unreconstructed Zr- and O2-terminated YSZ blocks clearly leads to heterostructures which do not follow conventional solid-state chemistry. They are either reduced in the case of Zr excess, or contain OO bonds in the case of O excess. It is, however, possible to construct symmetric YSZ blocks which are formally charge neutral. Adding O to each end of Zr-terminated YSZ blocks (Figure 1 e), gives rock-salt ordered ZrO terminating layers, similar to the SrO layers in STO (Figure 1 b, and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) and as observed experimentally for the surface of YSZ.14 The resulting symmetric ZrO-terminated YSZ blocks have the composition [Y2O3][ZrO2]18, and thus have neither excess Zr nor excess O. The ZrO-terminated YSZ blocks were combined with TiO2- and SrO-terminated STO blocks giving structures E and F, respectively. The final structures, optimized as for A–D, are shown in Figure 3. Structural diagrams of the interfaces formed within an STO-YSZ heterostructure using a ZrO-terminated YSZ block (depicted in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) and E: TiO2-terminated and F: SrO-terminated SrTiO3. To best display these two important structures, each structure is viewed along both of the two short lattice vectors, rather than just one. Ti atoms are at the center of the gray polyhedra, other atoms are colored as follows: Sr mid-gray, Zr light gray, Y dark gray, and O black. The calculated heats of formation for E and F were −2.5 and −6.7 eV, respectively. Structure E is more stable than the other two heterostructures with TiO2-terminated STO (A: 26.3 eV and C: −0.5 eV), and structure F is more stable than those with SrO-terminated STO (B: 27.1 eV and D: −5.1 eV). The heterostructure with SrO-terminated STO, F, is more stable than E, in good agreement with experimental observations that epitaxial growth of [001] oriented YSZ was only seen with SrO-terminated STO substrates.10 Models E and F show none of the structural problems found in A–D. The PDOS plots in Figure 4 show that both are undoped semiconductors, and no OO bonds are present in their structures. The calculated gaps (E: 1.78 eV, F: 1.37 eV) are similar to the calculated gap of STO (1.79 eV) which is smaller than that of YSZ. We therefore consider E and F to be the best representative models of YSZ-STO heterostructures proposed to date. We emphasise that they require reconstruction of the terminal layer of the YSZ block away from the bulk termination. Partial density of states of structures formed with ZrO-terminated YSZ and E) TiO2-terminated and F) SrO-terminated SrTiO3. Both materials have significant band gaps (DOS=density of states). A closer look at the structures of E and F in Figure 3 shows a surprising level of order at the interfaces between YSZ and STO, particularly the left-hand interface of E, and the right-hand interface of F. The first layers of YSZ at these two interfaces appear well ordered, although the other interfaces are less so. Furthermore, all of the Zr atoms in the YSZ layers directly neighboring the interfaces are seven-fold coordinate. This is the preferred coordination number of Zr in baddeleyite (monoclinic ZrO2),15 and an entirely reasonable coordination environment for the Zr atoms. In agreement with earlier work,7 we find that the Ti atoms in E are octahedrally coordinated. The YSZ terminating ZrO layer effectively caps the TiO2-terminating layer of STO continuing the perovskite structure with Zr in the A-site. In F, the terminating ZrO layer lies above the SrO-terminating layer of STO in a rock-salt like geometry resembling the layers of neighboring perovskite blocks in Ruddlesden–Popper structures.16 Thus, in both E and F, the ordered interfaces can be described in terms of simple, well-known structural motifs for metal oxides. The central region of YSZ in both E and F appears considerably less ordered than at the interfaces. This disorder is largely due to the strain imposed on the YSZ by the STO substrate, consistent with previous work.7, 8 Comparison of bulk YSZ structures calculated with and without strain in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, clearly shows the deviation from the fluorite structure upon the application of strain. One indication of this structural change is the alteration in the number of Zr and Y atoms bonded to each O. In unstrained YSZ this is four for each O atom, as expected in the fluorite structure. With the application of strain this drops to an average of 3.7 for bulk YSZ, similar to the values of 3.6 and 3.9 for the YSZ regions of E and F (neglecting O atoms at the interface). Similarly the average number of O atoms bonded to Zr and Y atoms drops from 7.8 in unstrained YSZ to 7.2 in strained YSZ and 7.1 and 7.3 in E and F. Although it is tempting to relate this change away from the fluorite structure to the increased ionic conductivity seen experimentally, we note that the O and Zr environments are in fact becoming close to those found in the most stable ZrO2 polymorph, baddeleyite. Baddeleyite has a distorted fluorite structure with an average of 3.5 Zr atoms bonded to each O atom, and each Zr atom coordinated to 7 O atoms,15 and YSZ in this structure does not have a greater ionic conductivity than cubic YSZ.17 Previous calculations on strained YSZ do suggest enhanced O diffusion, however not sufficient to fully account for the increased ionic conductivity observed in YSZ-STO heterostructures.18 In contrast to the YSZ region, the central STO region in all models remains largely unchanged (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), retaining the perovskite structure. The results of this study suggest that the buried YSZ-STO [001] interfaces within the heterostructure require reconstruction during the growth process of the component structures to permit energetically stable and crystal-chemically acceptable structures to form. We also confirm that the most stable heterostructure is formed with YSZ and SrO-terminated STO, in agreement with experiment.10 The structures proposed here can be used in calculating properties relevant to ionic transport, such as the influence of oxygen defects, or the concentration and site preference of Y atoms (in particular their proximity to the YSZ-STO interface), or molecular dynamics simulations. The prediction of possible structures could also be an aid to further experimental characterization of YSZ-STO heterostructures. It is interesting to note the relative stability of structures containing excess oxygen at the interface (models C and D), compared to those with oxygen deficiency (models A and B). This suggests further research into the possible contribution of excess oxygen at YSZ-STO interfaces to increased ionic conductivity. This study shows the benefit of choosing alternative terminations to the simple bulk terminations of materials when constructing repeating buried interfaces in artificial heterostructures. This is consistent with the known reconstruction of oxide surfaces, including YSZ[001]14, 19 and STO[001]20 but distinct as in a heterostructure the interfaces are buried. Our findings are relevant for such buried interfaces in many heterostructures, particularly those with layers which are not charge neutral such as A(III)B(III)O3 perovskites and materials with the fluorite structure.

Ramgopal",Nanoelectronics,"IntroductionOver the last 40 years, feature sizes in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies have been scaled from 3 μm to the current sub-50 nm using the ""top-down"" scaling techniques (Nowak, 2002).This ""scaling"" has resulted in an increased processing power and transistor density while reducing the cost per transistor (Chao Li et al., 2007).These classical methods employ a sequence of deposition, pattern definition, doping, lithographic and etching steps to build solid-state semiconductor devices and integrated circuits.As the process technologies scale beyond the sub-10nm feature sizes, above fabrication methods result in increased process costs, variability and longer fabrication turnaround times.To push the CMOS technology to its limits and to reap the benefits of scaling, non-traditional alternatives are needed while fabricating devices.One such approach is the use of ""bottom-up"" nanotechnologies or even a combination of the bottomup and the ""top-down"" fabrication methodologies (Wei et al., 2007).In the bottom-up approach, analogous to the biological systems, atoms or organic molecules are selfassembled to build electronic structures with novel electronic, optical, or magnetic properties.Integrated circuits obtained with this approach of molecular-level control of material composition and structure may lead to devices and fabrication strategies not possible with top-down methods (Amarchand Satyapalan et al., 2005).The field of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), especially mono and multilayer assemblies of organic materials on various substrates has been most extensively studied in recent years.The compelling force for this research is the importance of such formations to nanoelectronic device fabrication, for modifying the surface wetting/adhesion properties, for sensor applications and for corrosion resistance and molecular electronics (Kaushik Nayak et al. 2007).With the limitations in lithography techniques, to get features smaller than 10 nm, the molecular self-assembly provides the route to both smaller features and lower costs.Because of the ability to form layers with atomic resolution thickness and spacing, they are used as ultra thin resists and passivating layers.CNTs, polyphenylenes, porphyrins and DNA strands are some of the molecules that are being actively researched for the above applications (Reimers et al., 1996).7 www.intechopen.com",intech ebooks,,ebook platform,1,"['https://openalex.org/W1552013621',

In response to this need, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy issued a Research Call to develop nanomanufacturing capabilities at the National Laboratories. High performance catalysts represent a unique opportunity to deploy nanomanufacturing technologies. Re-refining of used lube oil offers an opportunity to create manufacturing jobs and decrease dependence on imported petroleum. Improved catalysts are required to produce a better quality product, decrease environmental impact, extend catalyst life, and improve overall economics of lube oil re-refining. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) in cooperation with Universal Lubricants, Inc. (ULI) and Chemical Engineering Partners (CEP) have carried out a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to prepare nanostructured hydrotreating catalysts using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to exhibit superior performance for the re-refining of used lube oil. We investigated the upgrading of recycled lube oil by hydrogenation using commercial, synthetically-modified commercial catalysts, and synthesized catalysts. A down-flow (trickle bed) catalytic unit was used for the hydrogenation experiments. In addition to carrying out elemental analyses of the various feed and product fractions, characterization was undertaken using H{sup 1} and C{sup 13} NMR. Initially commercial were evaluated. Second these commercial catalysts were promoted with precious metals using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Performance improvements were observed that declined with catalyst aging. An alternate approach was undertaken to deeply upgrade ULI product oils. Using a synthesized catalyst, much lower hydrogenation temperatures were required than commercial catalysts. Other performance improvements were also observed. The resulting lube oil fractions were of high purity even at low reaction severity. The products recovered from both the ALD and other processes were water-white (even those from the low temperature, low residence time (high space velocity), low conversion runs). These results indicate that highly upgraded recycle lube oils can be produced using ALD-deposited active metal catalysts.

Hubbard,,"nanotubes (MWNTs) and silver gallium nanoneedles. Since the entire vibration spectrum is measured with high frequency resolution (100 Hz for a 10 MHz frequency scan), the resonant frequencies and quality factors of the nanowires are accurately determined. Using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the elastic modulus and spring constant can be calculated from the resonance frequencies of the oscillation spectrum and the dimensions of the nanowires, which are obtained from parallel SEM studies. Because the diameters of the nanowires studied are smaller than the wavelength of the vibrometer's laser, Mie scattering is used to estimate the lower diameter limit for nanowires whose vibration can be measured in this way. The techniques developed in this thesis can be used to measure the vibrational spectra of any suspended nanowire with high frequency resolution Two different nanowires were measured - MWNTs and Ag{sub 2}Ga nanoneedles. Measurements of the thermal vibration spectra of MWNTs under ambient conditions showed that the elastic modulus, E, of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) MWNTs is 37 {+-} 26 GPa, well within the range of E previously reported for CVD-grown MWNTs. Since the Ag{sub 2}Ga nanoneedles have a greater optical scattering efficiency than MWNTs, their vibration spectra was more extensively studied. The thermal vibration spectra of Ag{sub 2}Ga nanoneedles was measured under both ambient and low-vacuum conditions. The operational deflection shapes of the vibrating Ag{sub 2}Ga nanoneedles was also measured, allowing confirmation of the eigenmodes of vibration. The modulus of the crystalline nanoneedles was 84.3 {+-} 1.0 GPa. Gas damping is the dominate mechanism of energy loss for nanowires oscillating under ambient conditions. The measured quality factors, Q, of oscillation are in line with theoretical predictions of air damping in the free molecular gas damping regime. In the free molecular regime, Q{sub gas} is linearly proportional to the density and diameter of the nanowire and inversely proportional to the air pressure. Since the density of the Ag{sub 2}Ga nanoneedles is three times that of the MWNTs, the Ag{sub 2}Ga nanoneedles have greater Q at atmospheric pressures. Our initial measurements of Q for Ag{sub 2}Ga nanoneedles in low-vacuum (10 Torr) suggest that the intrinsic Q of these nanoneedles may be on the order of 1000. The epitaxial carbon that grows after heating (000{bar 1}) silicon carbide (SiC) to high temperatures (1450-1600) in vacuum was also studied. At these high temperatures, the surface Si atoms sublime and the remaining C atoms reconstruct to form graphene. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) were used to characterize the quality of the few-layer graphene (FLG) surface. The XPS studies were useful in confirming the graphitic composition and measuring the thickness of the FLG samples. STM studies revealed a wide variety of nanometer-scale features that include sharp carbon-rich ridges, moire superlattices, one-dimensional line defects, and grain boundaries.

Sritirawisarn,,"This dissertation demonstrates the growth and optical characterization of ordered InAs/InP dot (QD) arrays grown by chemical-beam epitaxy (CBE). The creation of InAs/InP QD arrays is governed by self-organized anisotropic strain engineering of InAs/InGaAsP superlattice (SL) templates leading to the formation of linear ordered one-dimensional (1-D) InAs QD arrays on InP (100) substrates and a periodic square lattice of two-dimensional (2-D) InAs QD arrays on InP (311)B substrates. The photoluminescence (PL) emission of the InAs QD arrays reveals excellent optical quality up to room temperature (RT). The emission wavelength is tuned into the technological important 1.55-µm region for telecom applications through the insertion of ultrathin GaAs interlayers beneath the QDs. Electronic coupling in linear InAs QD arrays on InP (100) is revealed by temperature-dependent PL and polarization-dependent PL measurements. Identical emission wavelength of multilayer-stacked linear QD arrays is achieved by increasing the GaAs interlayer thickness in successive layers. Self-assembled semiconductor QDs have led to numerous device applications ranging from nanophotonics, nanoelectronics to information processing due to their three-dimensional carrier confinement. Owing to the modern crystal growth fabrication technologies, e.g. molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE), metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), and CBE, QDs and related structures can be prepared precisely at the atomic scale leading to the ultimate control of the QD shape, size, composition, and emission wavelength. In addition, control of the QD nucleation sites and QD ordering is the prerequisite for exploitation of new functionalities for novel devices. The most common technique to position the QDs is by using artificially patterned substrates where the pattern geometry is defined by electron-beam lithography. The main disadvantages are, however, the degradation of the structural and optical properties due to lithographic imperfections and etching defects. To tackle this obstacle, a novel technique for the lateral alignment of QDs was realized based on self-organized anisotropic strain engineering creating ordered strain-modulated SL template structures. In this study the concept is further developed and transferred from the previously investigated GaAs-based system by MBE to the InP-based system by CBE where the QD emission wavelength is more suitable for telecom device applications. For the InAs/InP system, usually the formation of various nanostructures such as elongated QDs, called quantum dashes (QDashes) or even wires (QWRs) is observed at practically identical growth conditions. Most probably this is due to the low lattice mismatch between InAs and InP of 3 % as compared to InAs and GaAs of 7 % and the strong As/P exchange reaction. In this study, we identify the surface morphology of the buffer layer as key parameter for the formation of InAs QDs or QDashes on lattice-matched InGaAsP on InP (100) substrates. Growth conditions leading to the formation of QDashes are always accompanied by a rough buffer layer morphology. Although other growth parameters such as higher growth temperature, larger As flux, and compressive buffer layer strain favor the formation of QDs, once, the buffer layer has a rough morphology, QDashes are formed during InAs growth. On the contrary, well-shaped and symmetric QDs are reproducibly formed on smooth buffer layers. Hence, we conclude that not the growth conditions during InAs depositions, but rather the related surface morphology of the buffer layer determines the formation of either QDs or QDashes, which both exhibit high optical quality. On smooth buffer layers, laterally ordered linear 1-D InAs QD arrays and a periodic square lattice of 2-D InAs QD arrays are formed by self-organized anisotropic strain engineering of InAs/InGaAsP SL templates on InP (100) and (311)B substrates, respectively. The SL template formation comprises InAs QD growth, thin InGaAsP capping, annealing at higher temperature, InGaAsP overgrowth, and stacking. This produces wirelike InAs nanostructures along [001] on InP (100) and spot-like InAs nanostructures oriented along ?45° off [-233] on InP (311)B substrates due to anisotropic adatom surface migration during annealing and lateral/vertical strain correlation during stacking. The orientation of the linear InAs QD arrays is determined by the elastically soft directions of the InP crystal and the substrate miscut. InAs QD ordering is governed by local recognition of the lateral strain field modulations on the SL template surfaces. The growth parameters for obtaining straight, well-ordered, and uniform QD arrays are optimized, such as InGaAsP cap layer thickness, annealing temperature, InAs amount and growth rate, and number of SL periods. The InAs QD arrays reveal strong PL emission up to RT. This is the advantage of self-organized QD ordering compared to methods based on artificial substrate patterning which often degrade the optical quality. The emission of InAs QD arrays is tuned into the important 1.55-µm telecommunication wavelength region by the insertion of ultrathin, 0.8 – 2.0 monolayers (ML), GaAs interlayers beneath the QDs which suppress As/P exchange during InAs QD formation. For the linear InAs QD arrays on InP (100) substrates, lateral electronic coupling of the QDs along the chains is observed as indicated by temperature dependent PL measurements and the linear PL polarization. The concept of self-organized anisotropic strain engineering for QD ordering has been extended for formation of more complex architectures of lateral QD arrays by combining it with step engineering on artificially patterned InP (100) and (311)B substrates. On shallow- and deep stripe-patterned InP (100) substrates, depending on the stripe orientation, the linear 1-D InAs QD arrays are rotated away from their natural direction due to the presence of vicinal stepped sidewall planes modifying the self-organization process, coexisting with QD free steep side facets on deep-patterned substrates. On shallow- and deep-patterned InP (311)B substrates only QD free side facets form with flat top and bottom areas, not affecting the natural ordering of the 2-D InAs QD arrays. On the deep-patterned substrates a row of dense QDs forms on top along the side facets due to their slow-growing behavior. In the last chapter, multilayer-stacked linear InAs QD arrays on InAs/InGaAsP SL templates on InP (100) substrates are realized. Identical emission wavelength of the stacked QD arrays in the 1.55-µm region at RT is achieved by increasing the thickness of the GaAs interlayer beneath the QDs in successive layers. The sub-ML increment of the GaAs interlayer thickness compensates the QD size/wavelength increase during vertical strain correlated stacking. This is the demonstration of a three-dimensionally self-ordered QD crystal with fully controlled structural and optical properties. Finally, further investigations of the physical and optical properties of the 1-D and 2-D InAs/InP QD arrays are envisioned for future research. Cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy (X-STM) or cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (X-TEM) is useful to obtain more information about material intermixing, geometry of the capped QD layers in the SL template structure to provide deeper insight into the growth mechanism and give input for possible theoretical models. Advanced optical measurement techniques, e.g., (time-resolved) single QD PL spectroscopy or magneto PL spectroscopy could further indicate the electronic coupling in the 1-D QD arrays. Moreover, selective-area epitaxy could lead to the formation of localized QD arrays on microscopic mesa patterns with complex arrangements. The growth rate enhancement in selective-area epitaxy by CBE on dielectric masked substrates, e.g., Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) or Silicon Dioxide (SiO2), is negligible compared to that in MOCVD due to desorption of group-III molecules (TMI, TEG) on masked areas. This allows the growth parameters to be controlled similar to those for unmasked planar substrates. The localized QD arrays could be useful for future applications such as information processing and computing.",,,,1,[],Sritirawisarn,,False,

Dean,,"Flexible Thin-film photovoltaic (TFPV) is a low cost alternative to incumbent c-Si PV products as it requires less volume of costly semiconductor materials and it can potentially reduce installation cost. Among the TFPV options, copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) has the highest efficiency and is believed to be one of the most attractive candidates to achieve PV cost reduction. However, CIGS cells are very moisture sensitive and require module water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of less than 1x10-4 gram of water per square meter per day (g-H2O/m2/day). Successful development and commercialization of flexible transparent ultra moisture barrier film is the key to enable flexible CIGS TFPV products, and thus enable ultimate PV cost reduction. At DuPont, we have demonstrated at lab scale that we can successfully make polymer-based flexible transparent ultra moisture barrier film by depositing alumina on polymer films using atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology. The layer by layer ALD approach results in uniform and amorphous structure which effectively reduces pinhole density of the inorganic coating on the polymer, and thus allow the fabrication of flexible barrier film with WVTR of 10-5 g-H2O/m2/day. Currently ALD is a time-consuming process suitable only for high-value, relatively small substrates. To successfully commercialize the ALD-on-plastic technology for the PV industry, there is the need to scale up this technology and improve throughput.

The different phase ratios were controlled by thermal treatment in vacuum to enhance the catalytic efficiency. The purpose to get mixed phases of TiO2 is to lower the electron/hole recombination rate to enhance the photo-induced decomposition ability. In addition, nitrogen was doped to TiO2 by ammonia gas to increase visible light absorption for better efficiency of photocatalyst.
 The support for TiO2 deposition was commercial MWCNTs that were inert and not easy to deposite with TiO2 by ALD method without treatment. By reaction with HNO3, defects and functional groups could be produced on the surface of MWCNTs so that TiO2 could be deposited on the surface as photocatalyst.

Modern electronic devices are dominated by conventional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Scaling of field-effect transistors (FETs) has been the key enabler for the tremendous progress in this field, in which the gate dielectric scaling is one of the most important tasks. While high-k gate dielectrics start to become part of Si technology and provide advantages over SiO2, such as smaller equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) and less gate leakage, engineering the interface between high-k materials and the Si channel has been a major obstacle and continues to be challenging. While atomic layer deposition (ALD) of high-k dielectrics is rather mature and has already been adopted by industry, a new technique, plasmaenhanced ALD (PE-ALD), is expected to open up new routes in thin film growth owing to its increased material choices, high throughput processing, and reduced growth temperatures. In this study, we focus on electrical characterization of high-k Al2O3 films deposited in a commercial PE-ALD tool, primarily using the Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) analysis. The goal is to identify optimal growth conditions. After measuring and analyzing C-V curves of Al2O3 films deposited by various conditions, the major findings are listed as follows: 1) besides the plasma assistance, 250°C growth temperature results in a higher relative permittivity and smaller hysteresis compared to lower temperatures; 2) post-growth annealing is necessary to eliminate most trapped charges. It is found that 600°C annealing most effectively reduces the hysteresis and oxide trapped charges, and is therefore the optimal annealing choice.",journal of purdue undergraduate research,"['2158-4052', '2158-4044']",journal,0,[],Jin,,False,

However, the growth of oxides on the III-V surface is more complex than that on Si. Most of these methods require condensed gases, energy sources (such as excited plasma, electric potential, or optical illumination) or ultrahigh vacuum chamber, and so on, which complicate the oxidation process.

The research was focused on zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires, in particular, which besides posing fundamental questions in physics, promise broad range of applications. ZnO nanowires were grown by chemical-vapour-deposition (CVD) using the vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism with gold particles as catalysts. Oxygen was introduced in the argon carrier gas and zinc was carboreduced from the ZnO/C mixture. We produced micrometer long ZnO nanowires and their diameter was controlled by the size of the gold catalyst particles. The diameter range of our ZnO nanowires is between 30 to 100nm. After growth, the alloyed particles were found at the top of the nanowires. ZnO nanowires are composed of single crystals of ZnO in the wurtzite phase. Growth direction is defined by their epitaxial relation with the substrate. From photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) characterizations, a deep impurity energy level at 2.3eV was found in a band gap of 3.3 eV, which could be related to oxygen off-stoichiometry. PL measurements showed that this energy level does not depend on the oxygen concentration used during the growth. Scanning-Tunnelling-Microscopy-based CL (STM-CL) measurements were made on single ZnO nanowires and showed that this energy level is likely to come from curved nanowires. Electrical measurements were performed on single nanowires, by using dielectrophoresis to place individual ZnO nanowires at a predefined location. E-beam lithography was used to deposit four metallic contacts on top of individual micrometer long ZnO nanowires. In order to avoid oxidation and the Shockley effect, we used chromium nitride (CrN) as electrical contacts. By measuring the temperature dependence on the resistance we extracted the activation energy of 2eV for charge transport, possibly arising from the same impurity level, as measured in PL. In the field-effect-transistor (FET) configuration, by using PMMA as dielectric layer and Cr as gate electrode, we extracted the charge carrier mobility of an individual ZnO nanowire as being 9.5 cm2/(Vs). In order to discover the origin of the energy level in the band gap, we measured the relaxation time of the current, after UV-illumination was switched off, and we found out that the surface states have significant effects. The elastic properties of individual ZnO nanowires were studied as a function of diameter and point defect/dislocation concentration. Using dielectrophoresis, nanowires were placed over a hole of a microfabricated Si3N4 membrane and, from bending measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) the Young's modulus was extracted. The diameter dependence of the Young's modulus showed a maximal value for a diameter of 50nm. Annealing under argon atmosphere showed an improvement of the Young's modulus which is explained by the removal of the defects/dislocations left during the growth. For comparison, the elastic properties of ZnS nanotubes produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD) were also measured. A clear dependence of the Young's modulus on the diameter and the wall thickness were found and attributed to the variation of the crystal structure of the nanotubes.",,,,0,[],Duchamp,,False,

The highly c-axis orientated, well crystallized ZnO epilayers and dominant ultraviolet (UV) near-band-edge emission with negligible defect-related bands were manifested by the X-ray diffraction pattern, transmission electron microscopy images and photoluminescence measurement. A low-threshold (33.3 kW/cm2) optically-pumped stimulated emission was observed in the ZnO epilayers. It was found that the threshold gradually decreased with the increase in the Al doping concentration in the ZnO films. The onset of random lasing was proposed to be the reason of the reduction in the threshold of stimulated emission.
The high-quality ZnO epilayers were grown by ALD on the p-type GaN and treated by rapid thermal annealing to form the n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The LEDs exhibited a competition between the electroluminescnce (EL) from the n-ZnO (λ=391 nm) and p-GaN (λ=425 nm). On the other hand, the effect of external feedback on the UV EL from n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs was also studied. The super-linear increase in the UV EL intensity from ZnO with the injection current was observed, attributed to the occurrence of amplified spontaneous emisson in the ZnO epilayer.
White-light EL from the n-ZnO/p-GaN hetrojunction LEDs operated at reverse breakdown bias was also reported. The EL spectrum was composed of the blue light at 430 nm and broad yellow band around 550 nm. The chromaticity coordinate of the EL spectrum was estimated to be (0.31,0.36), very close to (0.33,0.33) of the standard white light. Significant ultraviolet (UV) electroluminescence (EL) coupled with a red shift from n-ZnO/p-GaN hetrojunction LEDs diodes was observed under the reverse breakdown bias. The reverse breakdown is attributed to the type II band alignment with large band offsets between n-ZnO and p-GaN heterojunction, which facilitates electron tunneling from the valence band in p-GaN to the conduction band in n-ZnO.Theoretical calculations were carried out to fit the EL spectra, indicating that the excitonic Franz-Keldysh effect under a large electric field in the depletion region of p-GaN is responsible for the red shift in the UV EL spectra.
The crystal structures and optical properties of ZnO epilayers and the n-ZnO/p-GaN hetrojunction LEDs grown by ALD were studied in this thesis. The results indicate that the ALD technique is a very promising approach to the growth of high-quality ZnO epilayers for the next-generation UV photonic devices.",臺灣大學材料科學與工程學研究所學位論文,,journal,0,[],陳星兆,,False,

Cronauer,Fischer–Tropsch process,"Argonne National Laboratory carried out a research program to create, prepare, and evaluate catalysts to promote Fischer-Tropsch (FT) chemistry-specifically, the reaction of hydrogen with carbon monoxide to form long-chain hydrocarbons. In addition to needing high activity, it was desirable that the catalysts have high selectivity and stability with respect to both mechanical strength and aging properties. It was desired that selectivity be directed toward producing diesel fraction components and avoiding excess yields of both light hydrocarbons and heavy waxes. The original goal was to produce shape-selective catalysts that had the potential to limit the formation of long-chain products and yet retain the active metal sites in a protected 'cage.' This cage would also restrict their loss by attrition during use in slurry-bed reactors. The first stage of this program was to prepare and evaluate iron-containing particulate catalysts. Such catalysts were prepared with silica-containing fractal cages. The activity and strength was essentially the same as that of catalysts without the cages. Since there was no improvement, the program plan was modified as discussed below. A second experimental stage was undertaken to prepare and evaluate active FT catalysts formed by atomic-layer deposition [ALD] of active components on supported membranes and particulate supports. The concept was that of depositing active metals (i.e. ruthenium, iron or cobalt) upon membranes with well defined flow channels of small diameter and length such that the catalytic activity and product molecular weight distribution could be controlled. In order to rapidly evaluate the catalytic membranes, the ALD coating processes were performed in an 'exploratory mode' in which ALD procedures from the literature appropriate for coating flat surfaces were applied to the high surface area membranes. Consequently, the Fe and Ru loadings in the membranes were likely to be smaller than those expected for complete monolayer coverage. In addition, there was likely to be significant variation in the Fe and Ru loading among the membranes due to difficulties in nucleating these materials on the aluminum oxide surfaces. The first series of experiments using coated membranes demonstrated that the technology needed further improvement. Specifically, observed catalytic FT activity was low. This low activity appeared to be due to: (1) low available surface area, (2) atomic deposition techniques that needed improvements, and (3) insufficient preconditioning of the catalyst surface prior to FT testing. Therefore, experimentation was expanded to the use of particulate silica supports having defined channels and reasonably high surface area. An effective FT catalyst consisting of ALD-deposited Co and Pt on a silica support has been prepared and demonstrated. This catalyst was more effective than a similar catalyst deposited upon a support of ALD-deposited Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} on silica. This result implies that the deposition of Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} to form a support is not as effective as desired. The addition of Pt as a Co-containing catalyst promoter has been demonstrated; it appears to primarily affect the catalyst pre-conditioning step. Co on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst prepared by the Center for Applied Energy Research (CAER) is more effective than Argonne-prepared ALD-deposited Co on ALD-deposited Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst. The FT activity of ALD-coated Co catalyst on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} is about linear with Co level from about 9 to 25%. A cooperative research effort was undertaken to test the deposition of platinum on Co FT catalysts; this Pt influences the effectiveness of catalyst conditioning and its continuing activity. In summary, the ALD Pt at a low concentration (0.1 wt %) was as effective as that of the wet chemical deposition technique of CAER (specifically incipient deposition on a Co catalyst that had been prepared and calcined before the Pt deposition.) The ALD technique appeared to be nominally better than the incipient wetness technique that involved co-deposition of Pt and Co prior to calcination. The activation energy of the rate of CO conversion was tightly grouped about an average of 29.2 Kcal/mol when all of the Co-containing catalysts other than those with high Pt promoter levels were taken into account; this implies a uniform reaction mechanism. Catalysts containing Pt and Ru that were ALD-deposited on an ALD-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} coated catalyst support were found to be relatively inactive. Additional tests were made with a low concentration (0.1 wt %) of Ru or Ir deposited on the reference Co catalyst. The Ir coated catalysts were particularly effective. In support of the above, there was an opportunity to undertake a study of cobalt/promoter/support interaction using the Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne. A number of catalysts (including reference cobalt oxide and iron oxides) were tested using temperature programmed EXAFS/XANES experiments.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W208810203', 'https://openalex.org/W2128567477', 'https://openalex.org/W2334679715', 'https://openalex.org/W2561201275', 'https://openalex.org/W4243753222', 'https://openalex.org/W586102426', 'https://openalex.org/W586966134']",Cronauer,,False,

At the heart of the device is a mesoporous film of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles, which are coated with a monolayer of dye sensitive to the visible region of the solar spectrum. The role of the dye is similar to the role of chlorophyll in plants; it harvests solar light and transfers the energy via electron transfer to a suitable material (here TiO2) to produce electricity — as opposed to chemical energy in plants. DSCs are fabricated of abundant and cheap materials using inexpensive processes (e.g. screen-printing) and are likely to be a significant contributor to the future commercial photovoltaic technology portfolio. The work conducted during this thesis aimed at optimizing the DSC using three different strategies: The use of versatile organic sensitizers for stable and efficient DSCs, the study of tandem device architectures in combination with other solar cells to harvest a larger fraction of the solar spectrum, and the development of a validated optoelectric model of the DSC. Organic donor-π-acceptor dyes are an interesting alternative to the standard metal-organic complexes used in DSCs. Efficient photovoltaic conversion and stable performance could be demonstrated with three classes of donor systems, namely diphenylamine, difluorenylaminophenyl, and π-extended tetrathiafulvalene. The highest conversion efficiencies were obtained with a difluorenylaminophenyl donor system (η = 8.3 % with a volatile electrolyte and η = 7.6 % with a solvent-free ionic liquid, which was a new record for organic dyes at the time of publication). Surprisingly, efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye by the I-/I3- redox mediator was found with the π-extended tetrathiafulvalene system, even though the thermodynamic driving force was as low as 150 mV. So far driving forces of 300-500 mV had been regarded as necessary for efficient regeneration of the dye cation. Also, important structure-property relationships pertaining to the recombination of electrons with the electrolyte and to the stability of the device could be identified (i.e. effect of linear vs. branched structure, linker length, and moieties used). The power conversion efficiency of solar cells can be extended beyond the limit for a single cell (∼ 30 %) by using multiple cells with different optical gaps in a tandem device. DSCs and chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells have complementary optical gaps and are thus suitable systems for integration in a tandem device. It was shown that a monolithic DSC/CIGS tandem device has the potential for increased efficiency over a mechanically stacked device due to increased light transmission to the bottom cell, and a monolithic DSC/CIGS device with an initial efficiency of η = 12.2 % was demonstrated. The degradation of the devices — induced by the corrosion of the CIGS cell in contact with the I-/I3- redox mediator — could be retarded with a protective thin conformal ZnO/TiO2 oxide layer coated on the CIGS cell by atomic layer deposition. Finally, an experimentally validated optical and electrical model of the DSC has been developed to assist the optimization process, which is predominantly conducted by empirical means in the DSC research community. The optical model allows to accurately calculate the internal quantum efficiency of devices, i.e. the ratio of extracted electrons to absorbed photons by the dye, a crucial and so far difficult to determine characteristic. Intrinsic parameters — like injection efficiency, electron diffusion length, or distribution of trap states in the TiO2 — can be extracted from experimental steady-state and time-dependent data with the electric model. The model allows to make a comprehensive and quantitative loss analysis of the different optical and electric loss channels in the DSC. The model has been implemented with a graphical user interface for straightforward usage. All three optimization strategies — organic dyes, tandem architecture, and device modeling — developed during this thesis make a valuable contribution to the development and commercialization of inexpensive and high efficiency DSCs. They enable a comprehensive view of the system and pave the way for a systematic analysis and reduction of losses, which has been the ultimate route to success for several established photovoltaic technologies.",,,,0,[],Wenger,,False,

Increasing indium composition in the underlying layer resulted to formation of higher density and smaller size dots. Several large dots were also formed on the surface.

Hudzinskyy,Microcrystalline,"Hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) is a mixed-phase material consisting of crystalline silicon grains, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) tissue, and voids. Microcrystalline silicon is extensively used as absorber layer in thin-film tandem solar cells, combining the advantages of a low (indirect) band gap (1.1 eV), which results in an enhanced absorption of red and (near) infrared light, with an improved stability under light exposure (reduced Staebler–Wronski effect). However, due to the indirect nature of the band gap, relatively thick (1–2 µm) µc-Si:H films are necessary to achieve an efficient absorption of red and (near) infrared light, even when light trapping concepts are applied. Therefore, from a cost-perspective point of view, high growth rates (>1 nm/s) are required, preferably in combination with large-area (roll-to-roll) processing. The most common, and so far most successful, deposition technique is the capacitively-coupled plasma (CCP) in parallel plate configuration using radio or very high excitation frequencies (RF or VHF, respectively) and highly hydrogen diluted hydrogen and silane gas mixtures. Approaches to increase the growth rate include an increase of the plasma power, moving from a low-pressure to a high-pressure depletion (LPD to HPD, respectively) regime, and/or by increasing the excitation frequency from 13.56 MHz to 27–300 MHz. The combination of HPD-VHF has resulted in high deposition rates (2-3 nm/s) while maintaining high solar cell efficiencies (7-8%). In this work, the use of an ultra-fast (2-20 nm/s) deposition technique, i.e. the expanding thermal plasma, has been explored for the deposition of µc-Si:H films. Characteristic for ETP-grown µc-Si:H films is the lack of a sufficient amount of a-Si:H tissue, which is necessary to passivate the grain boundaries and fill the intergranular space, resulting in a network of (inter-connected) cracks and voids. As a consequence, the µc-Si:H films are prone to post-deposition oxidation, resulting in low solar cells efficiencies (<2%). The post-deposition oxidation has been monitored by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy over a period of 8 months. This study revealed a two-timescale oxidation: on short timescales (<3 months) the crystalline silicon grain boundaries oxidize, on longer timescales the oxidation involves also the a-Si:H tissue. This indicates that in order to prevent post-deposition oxidation, it is not sufficient to fill the intergranular space, but that the a-Si:H tissue needs to be of sufficient quality, i.e. dense and not susceptible for post-deposition oxidation. One process that could be responsible for the insufficient amount of a-Si:H tissue, is hydrogen-induced etching of a-Si:H tissue. Atomic hydrogen is, under µc-Si:H growth conditions, abundant in the plasma, and is known to preferentially etch a-Si:H over crystalline silicon (c-Si). In addition, the interaction of atomic hydrogen with the (growing) film can result in the formation of an hydrogen-rich sub-surface layer, caused by the insertion of atomic hydrogen into strained Si-Si bonds, which possibly explains the porous quality of the a-Si:H tissue. Monitoring the etch rate of a-Si:H films during Ar/H2 plasma exposure by real time spectroscopic ellipsometry showed that the hydrogen-induced etch rate was at least one order of magnitude lower than typical deposition rates. In addition, FTIR spectroscopy revealed that insertion of atomic H in the sub-surface layer (top ~30 nm) during Ar/H2 plasma exposure did not result in an increased porosity. These results suggest that the interaction of atomic hydrogen with the growing film is not responsible for the insufficient amount of (dense) a-Si:H tissue. The fact that the interaction of atomic hydrogen is not responsible for the poor material properties of ETP-grown µc-Si:H, the question what mechanism is then responsible? arises. To address this question the plasma chemistry and the resulting growth mechanism of ETP is compared to CCP, which so far is the only technique with which solar-grade µc-Si:H is obtained. One difference between the two techniques is the absence of an ion bombardment effect in ETP. In CCP the HPD and the use of VHF are employed to suppress a (potentially uncontrolled) ion bombardment effect, hypothesized to be responsible for an amorphization of the crystalline growth and defect incorporation. However, there is always some form of ion bombardment present. The extent to which ions contribute to the growth depends on the ion flux, the ion energy, and the chemical nature of the ion. Under HPD-VHF conditions SinHm+ is identified as the dominant ion in H2/SiH4 plasmas, but no direct ion energy and ion flux measurements under HPD conditions have been reported so far. Therefore, the ion energy and flux in a CCP reactor have been studied. For this purpose, a capacitively-coupled plasma reactor in parallel plate configuration has been designed and built, in close collaboration with the Institute of Photovoltaics at Forschungszentrum Julich (Germany). This reactor has been especially designed for the implementation of plasma and (in situ) film diagnostics. Under solar-grade µc-Si:H deposition conditions the contribution of ions to the film growth has been studied by means of a capacitive probe. The ion to Si deposition flux ratio was found to be large, ~0.30. However, since the ion energy is rather low,",,,,0,[],Hudzinskyy,,False,

Compared to coatings for visible light, the thicknesses and the permitted thickness errors are about a factor of 100 smaller, and the number of layers is typically a factor of 10 higher. Therefore, tighter control of the deposition process is required. For many coatings, the quality of the boundaries is the most important parameter for the performance of a coating. Boundaries have to be sharp within 1∕10 of the multilayer period [see Eq. (7.17)], and the search for deposition processes which produce sharp boundaries has been a major effort in the development of coatings for the x-ray region. The limits on the quality of the boundaries is of course determined by the size of the atoms, and some of the best boundaries reported in the literature (σ ≤ 3 Å) are close to this limit. Drastic improvements over such a value could only be expected with crystalline multilayer structures, where a perfect crystalline structure is maintained throughout the entire stack. Perfect boundaries would require that the growth of one atomic plane starts only when the previous plane is completely filled, and that one would be able to switch materials exactly at this moment.",spie ebooks,,ebook platform,0,[],Spiller,,False,

Sizyuk, A. Hassanein",Fusion power,"Summary form only given. During normal operation of the high confinement mode in future ITER device, edge-localized modes (ELMs) are a potential threat to the divertor components lifetime and plasma contamination. A major disruption or a giant ELM event has a complex sequence of interaction stages with the tokamak components: part of plasma energy released to SOL, then converted to heat load on divertor plate, heating/melting/vaporization of plate, vapor expansion and continued heating from impinging plasma particles, vapor shielding of direct plasma deposition to plate, conversion of plasma deposited energy into photon radiations, radiation transport in shielding layer, and then radiation deposition on nearby components. In this regard, configuration/geometry of tokamak wall and divertor components and the magnetic field structure is a key factor in the performance of the tokamak fusion reactor. To predict the outcome of the direct ELM plasma impact on the divertor plate, conversion of plasma energy into radiation in the shielding layer, and then the resulting energy deposition of this radiation flux to surrounding areas, comprehensive physical and numerical models are developed and implemented in HEIGHTS package. The integrated models included five main parts: Monte Carlo block of disrupting plasma particles interaction with solid, liquid, vapor, and plasma matter; magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) block of plasma evolution taking into account magnetic field diffusion; heat conduction and vaporization block for tokamak plasma facing components; heat conduction block for vapor and plasma; and Monte Carlo radiation transport. The radiation transport block is based on the optical data calculated by the HEIGHTS atomic physics package.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1979937942', 'https://openalex.org/W2046825839', 'https://openalex.org/W2054012743']",Sizyuk,,False,

Granqvist","Coalescence (physics), Transparent conducting film","Thin films of Au were made by sputter deposition onto glass substrates with and without transparent and electrically conducting layers of SnO2:In. The Au films were up to ~11 nm in thickness and covered the range for thin film growth from discrete islands, via large scale coalescence and formation of a meandering conducting network, to the formation of a more or less “holey” film. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy showed that the SnO2:In films were considerably rougher than the glass itself. This roughness influenced the Au film formation so that large scale coalescence set in at a somewhat larger thickness for films on SnO2:In than on glass. Measurements of spectral optical transmittance and electrical resistance could be reconciled with impeded Au film formation on the SnO2:In layer, leading to pronounced “plateaus” in the near infrared optical properties for Au films on SnO2:In and an accompanying change from such two-layer films having a lower resistance than the single gold film at thicknesses below large scale coalescence to the opposite behavior for larger film thicknesses.",advances in science and technology,"['1661-819X', '1662-0356', '1662-8969']",book series,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1974525961', 'https://openalex.org/W1994567365', 'https://openalex.org/W1994928310', 'https://openalex.org/W1995817698', 'https://openalex.org/W2014486329', 'https://openalex.org/W2044562203', 'https://openalex.org/W2059589690', 'https://openalex.org/W2070525551', 'https://openalex.org/W2090952572', 'https://openalex.org/W4235788612']",Lansåker,,False,

It builds on the company’s PeakForce Tapping technology to provide directly correlated quantitative nanomechanical data, which improves the sensitivity of the frequency-modulation measurement and eliminates artifacts. PeakForce KPFM also provides a completely automated parameter setup with Bruker’s ScanAsyst. The result is a significant improvement over existing surface potential measurement technologies in obtaining quantitative data for materials research and semiconductor applications. The PeakForce KPFM can be used as an accessory for the company’s Dimension Icon and MultiMode 8 AFMs. It includes the complete set of KPFM detection mechanisms (amplitude and frequency modulation), in conjunction with the tapping mode and PeakForce Tapping, and the ability to perform KPFM measurements over an extended voltage range.

It is suitable for electromagnet characterization systems used for magneto-optical studies, magnetic hysteresis tests, susceptibility measurements, Hall effect studies, spin magnetic resonance demonstrations, and biological tests. The model 648, intended for use with large electromagnets in high-precision laboratory settings that require low electrical noise, has a linear design that removes the undesirable higher-frequency noise typical of many other switch-mode power supplies. The low output noise means researchers can obtain greater resolution and finer detail from data taken during high-sensitivity experiments. Eliminating the need for external switching or operator intervention to reverse current polarity, the model 648 uses convenient bipolar, four-quadrant operation that provides clean transitions through zero without discontinuities.

Achromatic wave plates are constructed from at least two birefringent materials, typically quartz and magnesium fluoride. To manufacture an achromatic wave plate for use into the UV, Thorlabs used a compound plate design of quartz and sapphire. Not only is it manufacturable, but the design also leads to a much wider field of view than other materials because sapphire is a negative uniaxial crystal. In addition, since sapphire is a much harder material than MgF2, the new quartz–sapphire wave plates are much more durable and resistant to scratching.

First of all, AZO thin films were deposited on glass substrates using an RF magnetron sputter deposition method. The optical and electrical properties of AZO thin films with different deposition parameters, including sputtering power, T-S distance, working pressure and oxygen pressure, were investigated. According to the above analysis the best deposition parameters of AZO thin film can be determined. And then a three-layered thin film (AZO/Ag/AZO) was grown on the glass substrate to enhance the electrical conductivity. The Ag thin film was deposited between a fixed AZO thin film (5 ~ 15 nm) using a E-Beam deposition method. The different thickness of Ag thin film were applied. All the films obtained were characterized for the electrical and optical properties. The variation of the properties with Ag film thickness was investigated. For the physical property analysis of the AZO thin films, the microstructure and roughness of the AZO thin films which had been interlayer with different Ag thickness were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. For the optical property analysis of the AZO thin films, the transmittance and reflectivity of the AZO thin films which had been interlayer with different Ag thickness were measured by the ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-VIS).

Kane Jennings,"Ionomer, Nafion, Nanoporous","In the past five years, we have established a research program to investigate the integration of electrode/catalyst support, gas diffusion pathways, and ionomer into a single network based on a bottom-up, surface-directed approach. Here, the porous electrode surface provides the common foundation for both catalyst deposition and ionomer growth to develop a highly controlled process. Our efforts have focused on (1) the preparation of surface-initiated ionomer that can be grown from electrodes of essentially any geometry and is chemisorbed to the active electrode surface, and (2) the integration of this ionomer with both planar and 3-D electrodes that are atomically modified by Pt catalysts. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a single pore of such an integrated cathode where a catalytic Pt atomic layer is supported along the pores of a nanoporous gold electrode. The catalyst layer is electronically accessible from the metal cathode and in contact with proton-conducting ionomer to yield extremely high utilization efficiencies of the catalyst (approaching 100%) with the ultralow loadings expected from atomic overlayers. We have introduced a new class of ionomer film that is grown from the catalyst/electrode interface to develop proton conducting pathways throughout the 3-D electrode and to the adsorbed catalyst particles. This ionomer is a comb polymer designed to contain sulfonate-lined channels for rapid proton conduction as well as hydrophobic domains (fluorocarbon or hydrocarbon) to promote O2 solubility and transfer. This interfacial ionomer is designed to interface with a bulk membrane (such as Nafion) and an anode that could be engineered in a similar way. A key conclusion thus far is that ionomer and Pt catalyst can be integrated at a single interface (both 2-D and 3-D) to provide a high level of control over the construction of electrodes. To expand our efforts to date, we seek to utilize the materials chemistry we have developed to investigate how the depth-dependent structure of an ionomer film affects its performance in transferring protons and oxygen to accelerate the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction. By correlating structure and composition to performance and identifying barriers that limit efficiency, we seek to design ultra high performance ionomer films that are customized for the oxygen reduction reaction.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1977459241', 'https://openalex.org/W1992102192', 'https://openalex.org/W2007186702', 'https://openalex.org/W2040731673', 'https://openalex.org/W2095024801']",Jennings,,False,

Sessi,Magnetism,"In this thesis, the magnetic properties of self-assembled 3d and 4d metal nano-structures supported on surfaces have been investigated. The atomic coordination within the nano-structures was found to profoundly affect important quantities such as the magnetic moment and the magnetic anisotropy. The use of thin, atomically flat insulating Xe spacers of 1-15 monolayers (ML) thickness allowed for a study of coordination effects in the two limits of strong and weak coupling with an underlying metal substrate. The systems were characterized by surface-sensitive methods, based on synchrotron radiation (X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and X-ray scattering/diffraction) and variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (VT-STM). The VT-STM was developed and implemented during this PhD work. First, the magnetism of Rh nano-structures on a Xe buffer layer has been investigated. Rh is non-magnetic in bulk but shows a finite magnetic moment upon reducing cluster sizes to below 100 atoms. Within this work a small, non-zero magnetic moment was found for Rh nano-structures situated on Xe. The effect of intra-cluster Rh-Rh coordination was observed to affect both the spin and orbital part of the magnetic moment, leading to strongly oscillating values at smallest cluster sizes. Further, the analysis of the spectroscopic data suggests an interpretation for the absence of magnetism in directly deposited Rh on Ag(100) that is based on the formation of a kinetically promoted Ag-Rh alloy. Second, the buffer layer assisted growth (BLAG) was studied for sub-monolayer Co nano-clusters on Ag(111) and Pt(111) surfaces. The observation of the cluster formation process in the very early stages of BLAG revealed the paramount importance of the substrate in determining both magnetism and structural properties of the nano-clusters. On Ag(111), a weakly interacting substrate, the clusters form on the buffer layer independently from the metal substrate and show no magnetic anisotropy at this stage. As soon as the Xe is desorbed by sample annealing an in-plane anisotropy forms, as a consequence of the contact with the substrate. X-ray scattering and diffraction data support this interpretation and also show that in the limit of a single monolayer of Xe on Ag(111) the BLAG is a 'simple' atomic diffusion process, with a very high mobility of Co atoms on Xe. On a thick Xe buffer layer instead, due to a lower Xe-Xe binding energy and to the higher surface energy of Co compared to Xe, the deposition of Co provokes a re-arrangement of the Xe atoms. On the other hand, on Pt(111) the BLAG process fails to ensure a cluster formation process ontop the buffer layer and independent of the metal substrate. Here in fact, electric dipolar interactions occurring between Co atoms and the substrate through the Xe layer, are strong enough to destroy the Xe ML order and bring the Co atoms in direct contact with the Pt(111) before Xe atoms are thermally desorbed. This complex process becomes evident from VT-STM investigations and by the occurrence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy right after Co deposition on the Xe ML/Pt(111). In a detailed discussion it is shown that magnetic properties like magnetic anisotropy and orbital/spin moments are strongly entangled with their morphology. Both morphology and magnetism are determined by the interaction with the environment. This opens the way to more complex systems, where the interaction with the medium is tuned such as to gain nano-structures with a pre-defined structure and function. Third, the knowledge about the cluster-substrate interactions during BLAG was exploited to build highly ordered arrays of Co nano-structures on a patterned template substrate. In this case the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanomesh on Rh(111) was used. These systems have been employed to study the effect of hybridization of the Co d band with capping layers such as Pt, Au, Al2O3 and MnPt on the magnetic moment of Co. It was found that in all these cases Co clusters have no remanence, due to the small size and weak coupling with the h-BN atoms. However, it could be shown that capping the clusters strongly influence the clusters magnetization, in a non-trivial way.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1493655848', 'https://openalex.org/W1666853924', 'https://openalex.org/W2082397017', 'https://openalex.org/W619106852']",Sessi,,False,

In epitaxially grown silicon or a silicon-germanium layer, stress can affect the mobility of the carriers, and stress is introduced in devices for the purpose. In this chapter, we shall discuss the nature of biaxial stress in thin films, and the measurement of biaxial stress in thin films using the wafer-bending method. The chemical potential in a stressed solid that affects atomic diffusion and the time-dependent response of a solid to applied stresses in creep or stress-migration will be covered in Chapter 14.",cambridge university press ebooks,,ebook platform,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1534790618', 'https://openalex.org/W1572130436', 'https://openalex.org/W1974726872', 'https://openalex.org/W1993838312', 'https://openalex.org/W2035043262', 'https://openalex.org/W2045394403', 'https://openalex.org/W2052137108', 'https://openalex.org/W2061360173', 'https://openalex.org/W2329336141', 'https://openalex.org/W3021509614', 'https://openalex.org/W4244924614', 'https://openalex.org/W4301269891', 'https://openalex.org/W567061165', 'https://openalex.org/W619701525']",Tu,,False,

It is also known that the lipid layermakes the hairsur face hydrophobic and acts as a boundary lubricant to decrease friction resistance. 18-MEA can be easily removed; however, underalkaline conditions such as in the presence of hairbleach orper manent waving, the hairsur face becomes hydrophilic and the friction increases. The absence of 18-MEA may influence the sensory perception of hair, making it feel dried or hard to finger/comb through. We also found that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation affects 18-MEA on hair surface using Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). We therefore think it is important to study the damage to boundary lipids caused by the external stimuli in daily life. A technology for the deposition of a persistent hydrophobicity to bleached hair surfaces using 18-MEA is reviewed. It was found that the combination of 18-MEA with specific cationic surfactants system makes the bleached hair surface hydrophobic, and its hydrophobicity is maintained even after shampooing.

Interesting functionalities such as optical activity, host-guest binding and molecular recognition are based on effects at the single molecular level. To study the properties and functions of molecules at submolecular scale, an atomically defined environment with low contamination is of great advantage. This can for instance be provided on a clean surface in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), where surface sensitive analytical techniques and advanced nanostructure fabrication can be applied. Atoms and small organic molecules are easily transferred to a surface in vacuum by thermal sublimation. Many large, functional molecules, however, are nonvolatile and disintegrate at an elevated temperature, which hinders their application and investigation within the UHV environment. To explore the properties of nonvolatile molecules adsorbed at surface as well as the nanostructure fabricated from such molecules, electrospray ion beam deposition (ES-IBD), a technique capable of transferring nonvolatile molecules intact to surfaces in UHV, and in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are combined. A home-built ES-IBD setup allows molecular beam deposition with an unprecedented level of control: the ion beam composition is monitored by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) prior to the deposition, molecular flux and coverage controlled via the ion beam current and the beam energy can be measured and adjusted. The modified surfaces are characterized in situ by STM, which reveals structural and electronic properties with submolecular resolution. Moreover, ex situ analysis by atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows to access meso-scale structural formation. In addition, Laser Desorption Ionization (LDI), Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) are performed to check the chemical composition and purity of the adsorbed materials. This work first introduces the principles of our experiments and reviews of the literature on molecular ion beam deposition. In the following, the experimental method is characterized in detail using Rhodamine 6G, an organic dye, as a model system. It is shown that homogeneous layers of adsorbed, intact molecules are formed on the surface and single molecule adsorbates are observed by STM. An investigation by SIMS and LDI reveals that the kinetic energy of the molecular ions upon collision with the surface determines whether intact or fragment ions are deposited. Molecular layer growth was studied using cluster ion beams of the nonvolatile surfactant SDS, resulting in an arrangement of the molecules typical for surfactants in a head-to-head and tail-to-tail manner based on the structural motive. Crystalline structures are observed by AFM resembling inverted bilayer-membranes formed on graphite and SiOx surfaces. A similar structural feature revealed by STM is a flat-laying double row of the molecules on Cu(100) surface showing the robustness of the structural motive. The properties of single molecular functional systems are studied on two types of large functional molecules: macrocycle complexes and proteins. Macrocyclic host-guest complexes of the three cations: Na+, Cs+ and H+ trapped in the cavity of dibenzo-24-crown-8 (DB24C8) are formed in the electrospray solutions and transferred intact to the surface. Characterization by STM and density functional theory calculations shows the structure of the complexes with the alkali ion present in the cavity. The shape of the complex at the surface is also determined. Cytochrome c, an electron transfer protein is deposited on surfaces in UHV as an ion beam of high or low charge-state. STM reveals unfolded strands with distinguishable submolecular structural features after the deposition of high charge states. When low charge states are deposited, two significantly different structures are observed. Folded proteins appear as globular features of 2-3 nm diameter, while unfolded proteins are imaged as at strands. On Au(111) the unfolded strands fold into compact two-dimensional patches. Additionally, the variation in kinetic energy upon deposition and elevated surface temperature are also studied regarding the change in conformation of the adsorbed proteins. The results of this thesis open up new opportunities for the creation of functional nanostructures on surfaces. Both the preparation of layers and thin films as well as the controlled immobilization of single functional molecules were demonstrated with ES-IBD and characterized at submolecular resolution in situ by STM. A great variety of nonvolatile substances from small to large functional molecules with different binding motives like covalent, complex coordination or hydrogen bonds, is compatible with ESI and thus can be used as building blocks to construct new materials in a well-controlled manner.",,,,0,"['https://openalex.org/W1480392653', 'https://openalex.org/W1570166438', 'https://openalex.org/W1575472067', 'https://openalex.org/W1965379340', 'https://openalex.org/W1966120159', 'https://openalex.org/W1966545431', 'https://openalex.org/W1970471856', 'https://openalex.org/W1973238993', 'https://openalex.org/W1974732006', 'https://openalex.org/W1974830441', 'https://openalex.org/W1976293250', 'https://openalex.org/W1976472498', 'https://openalex.org/W1976634541', 'https://openalex.org/W1977520563', 'https://openalex.org/W1979387140', 'https://openalex.org/W1979841825', 'https://openalex.org/W1980770266', 'https://openalex.org/W1981368803', 'https://openalex.org/W1983382833', 'https://openalex.org/W1983468193', 'https://openalex.org/W1983534198', 'https://openalex.org/W1986304425', 'https://openalex.org/W1987278962', 'https://openalex.org/W1990375274', 'https://openalex.org/W1991078253', 'https://openalex.org/W1992028304', 'https://openalex.org/W1993683761', 'https://openalex.org/W2001453071', 'https://openalex.org/W2004728577', 'https://openalex.org/W2007682098', 'https://openalex.org/W2014935324', 'https://openalex.org/W2015517515', 'https://openalex.org/W2018871138', 'https://openalex.org/W2020995345', 'https://openalex.org/W2023586133', 'https://openalex.org/W2023790301', 'https://openalex.org/W2028494081', 'https://openalex.org/W2031253761', 'https://openalex.org/W2031999503', 'https://openalex.org/W2032194486', 'https://openalex.org/W2033353357', 'https://openalex.org/W2035875342', 'https://openalex.org/W2036588504', 'https://openalex.org/W2036961716', 'https://openalex.org/W2037537680', 'https://openalex.org/W2037849444', 'https://openalex.org/W2040141270', 'https://openalex.org/W2040306273', 'https://openalex.org/W2041308180', 'https://openalex.org/W2045288781', 'https://openalex.org/W2046509440', 'https://openalex.org/W2047205370', 'https://openalex.org/W2051468558', 'https://openalex.org/W2053585782', 'https://openalex.org/W2054210380', 'https://openalex.org/W2057184922', 'https://openalex.org/W2057527679', 'https://openalex.org/W2060530160', 'https://openalex.org/W2062551574', 'https://openalex.org/W2064135911', 'https://openalex.org/W2066329637', 'https://openalex.org/W2073292063', 'https://openalex.org/W2075184570', 'https://openalex.org/W2079949507', 'https://openalex.org/W2082241773', 'https://openalex.org/W2082604185', 'https://openalex.org/W2083919021', 'https://openalex.org/W2084698431', 'https://openalex.org/W2086189020', 'https://openalex.org/W2086456243', 'https://openalex.org/W2087858825', 'https://openalex.org/W2088468158', 'https://openalex.org/W2089181479', 'https://openalex.org/W2093175130', 'https://openalex.org/W2095031489', 'https://openalex.org/W2095050532', 'https://openalex.org/W2100537163', 'https://openalex.org/W2103080623', 'https://openalex.org/W2103658005', 'https://openalex.org/W2104040005', 'https://openalex.org/W2109159330', 'https://openalex.org/W2112779665', 'https://openalex.org/W2114899912', 'https://openalex.org/W2127570561', 'https://openalex.org/W2136776121', 'https://openalex.org/W2142224432', 'https://openalex.org/W2144098316', 'https://openalex.org/W2147592303', 'https://openalex.org/W2151381963', 'https://openalex.org/W2156436431', 'https://openalex.org/W2161574105', 'https://openalex.org/W2170164986', 'https://openalex.org/W2462929784', 'https://openalex.org/W2951210176', 'https://openalex.org/W2953100043', 'https://openalex.org/W3022980979', 'https://openalex.org/W3150248096']",Thontasen,,False,

Concerning the structural properties, all films presented uniform, dense and smooth surface. The films were annealed for 1 hour at different temperatures (200-600 °C) in an argon atmosphere. Annealing greatly decreased the resistivity of the films. Atomic Force microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed an increase in surface roughness of the annealed films with temperature. Improvement to the crystallinity was observed from the double layers (SnO2)/(ZnO) annealed at 300-400 °C and above with a slight decrease in the optical transmittance.

Plasmas have a miriad of applications. To mention just a few, plasmas are being used in the semiconductors industry, atomic layer deposition, plasma ion immersion implantation, eching, deposition of nano-structured layers, surface cleaning, gas cleaning, water cleaning, and other environmental technologies. When we think of biological surface processing, the largest added value was brought by the so called cold atmospheric plasmas. For biological applications, the temperature of the plasma should be maintained as low as possible so the biological structrures are not affected. The electrons in the discharge have a temperature of a few eV, but the gas can remain at room temperature or slightly above. Recent advances in cold atmospheric plasmas pushed the technology in such a way that it can be used for biomedical applications. Those plasmas are able to emit amounts of active species in such a way that they stimulate cell growth and wound healing, the emited radiation does not generate visible damage to the DNA, and they are operational at human body temperatures. Compared with low pressure plasmas, the design of such cold atmospheric plasma devices should enhance heat losses and reduce the applied power. A reduction in the heat losses can be achieved by using a reduction of plasma surface to volume ratio, while a low operating power can be achieved by reducing the operating voltage (lowest breakdown voltage for helium and argon). Plasmas operating in air require high breakdown voltages. In our experiments, we used two plasna devices: the plasma needle and the kINPen. The plasma needle is a device operating at 13.56 MHz. The device is using helium as feed gas with a ?ow rate of 0.5-2 l/min. The power input ranges from 10 mW to several Watts. The plasma needle generates a micro-plasma (0.1-2 mm glow size). In the 10-300 mW regime the gas temperature is about the same as the body temperature, above 1 W it can increase to 1000C and more. The plasma needle has been used for experiments on living cells, bacterial inactivation and skin. The intended applications are: wound healing, and the stimulation of cell proliferation. The glow can be applied directly to the tissues without causing any damage or discomfort. The second plasma source that we used was the kINPen 09, produced by the INP Greifswald, Germany. The device consists of a hand-held unit for the generation of a plasma jet at atmospheric pressure, a power supply, and a gas supply unit. In the centre of a quartz capillary (inner diameter 1.6 mm) a pin-type electrode (1 mm diameter) is mounted. In the continuous working mode, a high frequency (HF) voltage (1.1MHz, 2-6 kVpp) is coupled to the pin-type electrode. The plasma is generated from the top of the centred electrode and expands to the surrounding air outside the nozzle. The kINPen can be operated in helium, argon and compressed air. Several cell lines have been exposed to the effects of cold atmospheric plasma. We used 3T3 cells, human dermal ?broblasts (HDF), Cho K1, HeLa cells and keratynocytes. In the case of 3T3 cells, the plasma needle resulted in a higher proliferation rate (reduction of the doubling time with 40 %) and a faster wound healing. Best results were obtained when the duration of the treatment was 10 -15 seconds, when a complete wound model healed in 3 days compared with 7 days for the control. No visible DNA damage was observed. Application of the helium-operated kINPen resulted in a still higher proliferation rate compared with the control, but less signi?cant compared with the plasma needle. The effect is partly due to the high electric ?elds present in the plasma needle: the electrical ?elds are lower in the kINPen. Keratinocytes did not show such a high growth rate enhancement. HeLa cancer cells proved to be very sensitive to plasma treatment: they die readily after even a brief exposure to the plasma medium. Treatment of burned skin with the Plasma Needle results in a faster outgrowth in terms of the number of nuclei per outgrown micrometer, but not in a correspondingly larger outgrowth length. The Plasma needle results in effects which are larger than for the kINPen, which in turn is more effective than the control (untreated). The enhancement of growth rates of ?broblasts was also observed in static electrical ?elds, without plasma. In 3T3 ?broblast cell cultures, we have observed a threshold value of about 2.04 kV/m when measured in the air (around 1 V/cm in the liquid). Electrical ?elds below this threshold do not modify the cell growth rate at all. Electrical ?elds above this value do cause a remarkable increase in growth rate of about a factor 2. At the threshold value, longer exposures seem to result in inhibition of the growth. For electrical ?eld values above 4.7 kV/m, this inhibition is not observed: the growth rate increase is maintained over many days. This remarkable effect has been observed in 3T3 cells only. CHO-K1 cells, keratinocytes and bacteria do not seem to react at all to electrical ?eld exposure. In the case of bacteria, experiments had been performed on Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Staphilococcus Aureus. When the plasma needle was used, with helium as feeding gas, no effects of the plasma treatment were observed compared with the control. A comparison between helium, argon and compressed air plasmas was performed using the kINPen. Helium plasmas are not very ef?cient: even after 5 minutes of treatment a lot of CFU’s were still present on the plate. Promising results were obtained for argon, and the best results were obtained in compressed air plasmas. The basic difference between these three plasmas is the chemistry. Electrical ?elds and ion bombardment are comparable for these conditions, but the chemical composition of the cocktail that arrives at the surface of the bacteria is very different. Compressed air plasmas produce a very reactive of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (RON) like nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, hydroxyl radicals, etc. In plasmas in helium or argon, these species are created in the air entrained in the plasma jet, which is, of course, less productive then a direct plasma in air. The results suggest that the composition and thickness of the outer cell membrane play an important role in the process of plasma based bacteria inactivation. Gram positive bacteria (S. Aureus) seem to be more sensitive to plasma treat-ment than gram negative bacteria (P. Aeruginosa). Different mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain different sensitivity of different bacterias against plasma treatment. The of reactive species produced by the plasma (NOx, H2O2, OH radicals, ozone, UV etc) triggers the breaching of the membrane. Apparently, the thick lipopolysacharide outer membrane of gram negative bac¬teria is a better shield to reactive plasma species than the thinner peptidoglycans membrane of gram positive bacteria. All these results clearly suggest that plasma treatment offers perspectives for wound healing: bacteria can be killed or inactivated, cancer cells die, but ?broblasts are stimulated in their proliferation. Eventhough the results are promising, and clinical tests around the world indicate an enormous potential, the toxicity on longer terms still need to be addressed further before the technique can really be sent into the market.",,,,0,[],Tipa,,False,

Besides, the 3D p-i-n nanostructure enhances the sensitivity of the sensor, from 498.5% of the conventional 2D thin film type to 1652%. In addition, under 200 oC, 3V reverse bias and 100ppm methane ambient, the WO3 sensing element can attain the highest sensitivity of 152.9%, which is more than 85.5% and 21.9% for SnO2 and ZnO, respectively. Furthermore, the WO3 has the fast response time of 20 sec and the highest selectivity compared with hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases. In this work, under 200 oC and 100ppm ambient, the developed 3D nanorod p-i-n CH4 sensor has the best performance of 152.9% and 20 sec, respectively for sensitivity and response time. The performances are better than that of 18% and 52.2 sec for the reported Pt/ZnO/Zn MSM Schottky diode under same conditions.",,,,0,[],王厚入,,False,

Thin electrolyte membranes of less than one micrometer thickness have been shown to yield reasonable power densities. It remains, however, challenging to produce membranes with a high performance over a long time. While ohmic losses in the electrolyte can be reduced by reducing its thickness, polarization losses in cathode and anode layers are more difficult to get under control. It is generally found the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) on the cathode are limiting the performance. The goal of this thesis is to realize the membrane fabrication based on silicon micromachining technology and improve the performance of micro-SOFC devices by studying the relevant properties of the materials in positive electrode-electrolyte-negative electrode (PEN) elements of generic cell configuration. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is the most favored material for the electrolyte in devices of all scales. It potentially meets the requirements for micro-SOFC's as the YSZ film thickness can be scaled down to optimal thickness, even though the membrane becomes very fragile. In this work, sputter deposition was used for YSZ thin films. This process leads to a considerable residual stress that is not compatible with thermal misfit strain, but must be assigned to defects created during sputter deposition or cool down in the sputter chamber. This stress can be a major factor to destabilize the membrane during operation. Indeed, a thermal post processing treatment was necessary for achieving YSZ films with thermal mismatch stress only. We thus studied the impact of deposition conditions and evaluated the impact on film microstructure and morphology, electronic conductivity and mechanical stress. The stress evolution with temperature demonstrates that the residual stress strongly correlated with oxygen gas pressure during deposition and cool down. The compressive stress of as-deposited YSZ films was relaxed by cooling in oxygen atmosphere. The excessive compressive stress is irreversibly removed by annealing at 600°C in air. The relaxation sets in at about 400°C. This phenomenon could be explained by the mobility of additional oxygen vacancies in the edge dislocation core. Therefore, excessive stress could be avoided by tuning deposition conditions and post-treatment. Durable electrolyte membranes were obtained by such processes. Moreover, PEN operation revealed a high concentration of electrochemically active sites on their surface. Since the polarization loss on the cathode is a key issue in cell performance limitation, we studied the simplest geometry with a defined, circular TPB line and a strong catalytic material like platinum as cathode metal in combination with 200 µm diameter electrolyte membranes obtained by silicon micromachining. The anode function was provided by a ceria doped gadolinia (CGO) layer, which is known to be electrically conductive at the reducing fuel gas atmosphere (one atmosphere of 25 % H2/ 75 % Ar). To our knowledge, we were the first to measure directly the current and power density per TPB length. An open circuit voltage of 0.93 V and an ionic current density per length of TPB of 1.24 mAm-1 were measured at 450°C at maximal power. Considering literature values for oxygen diffusion activation on Pt, the active zone supplying atomic oxygen to the triple phase boundary was calculated to be 22 nm wide at most. The active zone of metal is critical for designing and optimizing the microstructure of the composite electrodes with electronic and ionic conducting phases. Nano-porous Pt films thus look as ideal candidates for cathode layers. However, Pt films showed a strong dewetting on YSZ surfaces. We studied the possibility to stabilize a porous Pt structure within a composite film in order to obtain a temperature stable and high catalysis metal/ ionic conductor composite. The investigated materials cover combinations of (Pt, IrO2, Ni)-(YSZ, CGO). Nano-structured electrode films with metal nano-phases and amorphous/nano-crystalline oxide phases were designed and fabricated using a multi-source sputtering system. Metal formation and the presence of nano-phases in an amorphous oxide phase were confirmed by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The nano-structured composite electrodes showed improved electrochemical performance in oxygen reduction because of the presence of the metal nano-phases leading to longer TPB lines as compared to pure Pt electrodes. However, upon heating, segregation of metal phase in the composite was observed. Pt based composites in addition have shown strong compressive stresses, which promote recrystallization for stress release even more. It has been found that the microstructure and the amount of the metal phase are critical to conductivity. The segregation of IrO2 in the composite was also observed in the IrO2-YSZ and IrO2-CGO composite thin films. IrO2 based composites showed clearly less dewetting phenomena than Pt based composites. The Pt versions integrated onto electrolyte membranes showed all a too small in-plane conductivity to be efficient as PEN cathodes. The cells with a Pt-YSZ composite cathode layer covering the complete YSZ/CGO membrane showed that the cell peak power density was increased by a factor of 5 to 5 mWcm-2 as compared to the ring shaped Pt electrode at the border of the membrane. The open circuit voltage dropped to 0.68 V at 450°C, most likely by increased leakage either through the PEN structure, or through a path outside of the cell. Even though the Pt-YSZ composite film reveals improvements, it cannot be exploited as a good cathode to achieve a sufficient TPB lines due to Pt grains re-crystallization leading to a loss of electrical connectivity. The tested composite cathode layers were thus inadequate to contact the complete membrane area, leading to a too large area specific resistance (ASR) in the interior of the cell.",,,,0,[],Yan,,False,

A promising alternative to electrons is the use of spin wave excitations. This has ushered a potentially powerful solution towards fabricating devices that use these excitations to transmit and process information (Khitun and Wang 2006). This new approach to information-processing technology, known as magnonics, is rapidly growing (Kruglyak and Hicken 2006), and key magnonic components such as spin wave guides, emitters, and ï¬lters are currently explored (Choi et al. 2007). The first working spin wave based logic device has been experimentally demonstrated by Kostylev et al (2005). In the present paper we develop and apply a model to analyze the spin dynamics for iron-gadolinium films of a few Gd(0001) atomic planes between two Fe(110) atomic planes. These ultrathin systems may be deposited layer by layer on a nonmagnetic substrate using techniques like dc-sputtering or pulsed laser deposition. They constitute prototypes for iron-gadolinium nanojunctions between iron leads in magnonics. In this system the Fe/Gd interfaces present structural disorder due to the mismatch between the Fe_bcc and Gd_hcp lattices. This engenders a quasi-infinite ensemble of Fe-Gd cluster configurations at the interface. In the absence of DFT or ab initio results for the magnetic Fe-Gd exchange, we have developed an integration based analytic approach to determine the spatial dependence of this exchange using available experimental data from the corresponding multilayer systems. A dynamic non-local CPA method is also developed to analyze the spin dynamics for the disordered systems. This DNLCPA introduces the idea of a scattering potential built up from the phase matching of the spin dynamics on structurally disordered Fe-Gd interface clusters with the spin dynamics of the virtual crystal. This method accounts properly for the quasi-infinite ensemble of interfacial structural configurations, and yields the configurationally averaged Green&amp;#39;s function for the disordered system. The computations yield the spin wave eigenmodes, their energies, life-times, and local densities of states, for any given thickness of the ultrathin magnetic Fe-Gd film. Fig.1 DNLCPA calculated dispersion branches for the spin waves propagating in the ultrathin magnetic 1Fe-5Gd-1Fe film (7 atomic planes) presenting structural interfacial disorder. The normalized energies are in units of iron exchange and spin J(Fe-Fe)S(Fe). The curves are plotted as a function of the y-component of the wave-vector (inverse angstroms), the z-component = 0, in both figures.

Middleton",Amyloid (mycology),"An der Oberfläche von Aβ1-40-Amyloidfibrillen mit dreifacher Molekülsymmetrie (grün im linken Bild) wurde eine Bindungsstelle für das Glycosaminoglycan-Analogon Heparin (blau) identifiziert. Die Bindungsstelle besteht aus Resten am N-Terminus und der Region, die den Scheitel des Dreiecksmotivs bildet. Heparin hat eine niedrigere Affinität für Aβ1-40-Fibrillen mit zweifacher Symmetrie, wodurch eine beachtliche morphologische Selektivität offenbar wird. Over 30 proteins and peptides self-assemble into amyloid fibrils and plaques that are the pathological hallmark of human disorders; the most famous peptides are the 40- and 42-residue amyloid beta peptides Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1 As early as 1850 it was suggested that amyloid deposits in tissue are associated with carbohydrates, later identified and classified as proteoglycans2 and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides,3 and these factors are now known to accumulate in AD plaques.4 GAGs, such as heparan sulfate and the closely-related polysaccharide heparin, increase the rate of Aβ polymerization5 and markedly affect the resulting fibril morphology6 and neurotoxicity.7 GAG mimics, which accelerate fibril deposition and eliminate cytotoxic amyloid species, are being evaluated clinically as AD therapies.8 Precisely how GAGs interact with Aβ fibrils is not known, but the sequence H13HQK is a predicted heparin binding motif9 and solid-state NMR (SSNMR) data suggest that the N-terminal arginine R5 is also involved.6 Here, we examine in detail the GAG binding interface in Aβ1-40 fibrils using 13C SSNMR spectroscopy, linear dichroism (LD), and enzymatic assays. By using 5 kDa heparin as an established proxy for GAGs,10 we report the first atomic details of a GAG binding site on the surface of Aβ1-40 fibrils based on direct structural measurements. Aβ1-40 fibril morphology is highly dependent on assembly conditions,11 and restraints from SSNMR experiments revealed that this polymorphism originates from differences in structure and organization at the molecular level.12 Aβ1-40 fibrils assembled under quiescent conditions exhibit threefold molecular symmetry (“3Q” morphology),12b while fibrils formed with agitation exhibit twofold molecular symmetry (“2A” morphology; Figure 1 A).12a, 12c Here, uniformly 13C/15N-labeled Aβ1-40 fibril samples were prepared by elongation of 2A or 3Q fibril seeds.12b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that fibrils had formed successfully in these seeded growth experiments (Figure 1 C, left, and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Two-dimensional 13C–13C SSNMR spectra of these samples (Figure S2 in the SI) exhibited well-resolved signals consistent with the expected homogeneous fibril morphologies. These morphologies were confirmed as 2A and 3Q by comparing the diagnostic chemical shifts with documented values (Tables S1 and S2, and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Seeded 2A and 3Q fibrils that assembled in the presence of a fivefold mass excess of 5 kDa heparin appeared to be unaffected morphologically according to TEM (Figure 1 C). However, spectra of the two fibril types in the presence of heparin collected using the differential absorbance technique, flow LD13 (see the Supporting Information), were strikingly different from the spectra of the fibrils alone (Figure 1 B). Spectra of the fibrils without heparin showed a small amide signal at about 200 nm and only weak signals in the aromatic region around 280 nm (c.f. no aromatic signal was observed in Aβ1-42 fibrils in reference [12]). This result indicates that fibrils are present, but they do not orient particularly well in shear flow. The 3Q fibrils give the higher LD signal, possibly because the characteristic higher mass-per-length of 3Q fibrils11 results in stiffer fibrils, which align better than 2A fibrils. For fibrils assembled in the presence of heparin, a larger LD signal is observed in the amide region for both 2A and 3Q fibrils, but the magnitude of the signal enhancement is different for the two morphologies (Figure 1 B). These data indicate that heparin binds to both fibril types, and the observed enhancement in LD signal results either from a difference in their binding affinity for heparin, and/or from differences in the ability to align the heparin-bound fibrils under flow. Stronger signals observed at 280 nm and 240 nm (Figure 1 B, insets) are consistent with alterations in tyrosine–tyrosine interactions involving the sole tyrosine (Y10) near the flexible N terminus.14 Furthermore, small peaks between 250 nm and 280 nm that are due to ordering of the phenylalanines (F4, F19, and/or F20)14 are observed. To quantify heparin binding directly, an experiment was designed in which fibrils in the presence of heparin were sedimented and the heparin concentration in the supernatant was determined enzymatically using heparinase I. Heparin binding to 2A fibrils (Figure 1 D, •) is considerably weaker than binding to 3Q fibrils, the latter of which reached saturation at sub-equimolar concentrations (Figure 1 D, ▪). Hill analysis of the data for 3Q suggests that heparin binding is cooperative with an estimated KD of 34 μM and a stoichiometry of approximately one heparin molecule per four Aβ1-40 molecules at saturation (i.e., 4.5 saccharide units per Aβ1-40 monomer). The LD and enzymatic experiments together reveal marked differences in heparin binding to the two Aβ1-40 morphologies. Binding of heparin to fibrils of Aβ1-40 with different morphology. A) Models of the 3Q (left) and 2A (right) fibrils viewed down the fibril long axis Z.9 Each model comprises six layers of hydrogen-bonded peptides produced using coordinate pdb files, from Dr. Robert Tycko, with flexible N-terminal residues (not restrained by NMR data) added. B) Flow LD spectroscopy of 3Q (left) and 2A (right) fibrils (0.9 mg mL−1) in the absence or presence of a fivefold mass excess of 5 kDa heparin.

Fibrils were grown alone or with a fivefold mass excess of 5 kDa heparin added during fibril formation. Scale bar is 200 nm in all images. D) Heparin binding to 3Q (▪) and 2A fibrils (•). Results shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.) from experiments carried out in triplicate. Data were analyzed using nonlinear regression fitted using the Hill equation (solid lines). The fibrils were suspended at 0.9 mg mL−1 before sedimentation. Further 2D 13C–13C SSNMR spectra were obtained for 2A and 3Q fibrils prepared by seeding in the presence of a fivefold mass excess of heparin. Chemical shift perturbations for selective main-chain carbon atoms or side-chain carbon atoms were indicated by significant movements of some cross-peaks for 3Q fibrils in the presence of heparin (Figure 2, left panels, and Figure S4 A in the Supporting Information). Similar perturbations were observed when heparin was added after preassembly of the 3Q fibrils (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), thereby suggesting that the interaction site is situated on the external face of the fibril assembly. Residues significantly perturbed in the presence of heparin are E22, S26, N27, A30, I31/I32, and H13/H14, with additional perturbations of the visible cross-peaks for residues in the flexible N terminus (E3, R5, and H6) (Figure 2 B, left and Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, cross-peaks for residue D23 are visible only in the spectrum obtained in the presence of heparin (Figure 2 A, left, red). Chemical shift perturbations observed in the aromatic region are consistent with the aromatic interactions detected in the LD experiments, but spectral overlap prevented the identification of specific residues. Figure 3 A highlights the positions of the heparin-sensitive residues on the modeled structure of 3Q fibrils and reveals that they are clustered in the unstructured N-terminal region (residues 1–8) and the turn at the apices of the triangular geometry. In contrast, very few significant changes in chemical shifts were observed for the 2A fibrils in the presence of heparin (Figure 2 B, right panels, and Figure S4B in the Supporting Information), consistent with lower-affinity heparin binding to this morphology. 13C dipolar assisted rotational resonance (DARR) SSNMR spectra of Aβ1-40 fibrils.

The regions bounded by red lines indicate the mean linewidth at half height (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Significant perturbations are taken to be >|±50 %| of the mean half-height linewidths for 3Q and 2A. Some resonances (e.g., for some valine residues) could not be assigned unambiguously owing to spectral overlap. Cα=▪, Cβ=○, Cγ=▵, Cδ=▿, Cζ=◊. Models for the GAG–fibril interface for 3Q fibrils. A) A single threefold symmetric layer showing the proposed heparin binding region (circled). Residues that undergo significant chemical shift perturbations in the presence of heparin are highlighted in blue. B) Models of heparin bound to 3Q fibrils were generated using chemical shift perturbations to define the search area. The binding site is defined by residues in the turn (E22, S26, N27, K28) and flexible N terminus (E3, R5, H6). Side chains from residues that show chemical shift perturbations in the presence of heparin are displayed, with positively charged residues highlighted (blue). The negatively charged surface of heparin is shown in red. Alternative arrangements are shown with heparin positioned parallel with (left) and perpendicular to (right) the fibril axis Z. Images were generated using CCP4 mg molecular graphics software.16 C) Experimental PSD spectrum (red) and simulated spectrum (black) corresponding to residues encompassed by the circled region in (A). Details of the docking and NMR simulations are available in the Supporting Information. Independent rounds of simulations of heparin docking with a model of 3Q fibrils comprising 18 Aβ1-40 molecules were carried out using a search area (Figure 3 A) encapsulating residues for which significant chemical shift perturbations were observed. No constraints were imposed on the orientation of heparin and simulations indicated that heparin can associate with the fibril surface either parallel with the fibril axis (Figure 3 B, left, and Figure S7 in the Supporting Information) or perpendicular to the fibril axis (Figure 3 B, right, and Figure S7). Favorable free energies of binding were calculated for the two heparin orientations (−5.5 kcal mol−1 for parallel and −2.8 kcal mol−1 for perpendicular). A perpendicular orientation allows the heparin/Aβ1-40 stoichiometry of 1:4 estimated from the heparinase data, but this stoichiometry is not possible in a parallel orientation unless there is a second interaction site, perhaps involving the H13HQK motif or the aromatic residues producing the enhanced LD signal. Heparin binding to the 3Q fibrils was probed further in a 13C-detected proton spin diffusion (PSD) NMR experiment15 (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). Cross-peaks (Figure 3 C, red) arise only from residues in closest contact with the ligand and residues that are remote from the ligand remain silent. A simulated spectrum (Figure 3 C, black) for residues within the circled binding region agrees well with the experimental spectrum, with overlap of many cross-peaks, although there are differences. Some predicted cross-peaks are absent from the experimental spectrum (e.g., for D23 and N27), and additional cross-peaks are observed that are not accounted for in the simulated spectrum (e.g., for H14). These discrepancies may arise because the complex spin-diffusion pathway is not modeled adequately, and because additional heparin binding sites may contribute to the spectrum. Crucially, spectra simulated for other possible binding sites outside the proposed region fit much more poorly with the experimental spectrum (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). In summary, we report the first detailed molecular insights into a recognition site for heparin, which is a proxy for GAG, within Aβ1-40 fibrils. GAGs are ubiquitous components of amyloid deposits in vivo and may be complicit in amyloid pathogenicity.18 A fascinating outcome of this work is the profound difference seen in the binding of heparin to the 2A and 3Q fibril types. The distinct packing geometries of the cross-β units of the 2A and 3Q fibrils may explain the different affinity of heparin for the two morphologies. Specifically, in the 3Q fibrils the N-terminal region lies in close proximity to the loop that links the two β strands in each monomer. This arrangement is not found in the 2A fibrils, thus possibly rationalizing the unique ability of heparin to bind tightly to fibrils of the 3Q type. Importantly, we show that GAG–amyloid interactions can differ according to the morphology of fibrils assembled from the same protein sequence. Further structural studies will be needed to determine how the binding site and mechanism differs in fibrils and their polymorphs formed from other protein sequences known to colocalize with GAGs, or how binding to the fibrils is influenced by GAG length. This work establishes a platform for such studies and for the structure-inspired design of compounds that target GAG–polypeptide interactions for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.9, 19 SSNMR experiments were performed below −20 °C on Bruker 400 MHz and 850 MHz spectrometers at MAS frequencies of up to 14 kHz. LD spectra of aligned fibrils were recorded using a microvolume Couette cell alone and in the presence of heparin. Molecular docking simulation of heparin onto Aβ1-40 seeded fibrils was performed using the AutoDock Vina 1.0 package.17 Heparin binding was determined using heparinase cleavage of heparin remaining in solution following centrifugation (15 min, 14 000 g) of Aβ1-40 fibrils and associated heparin. Heparinase I cleaves the glycosidic linkage, thereby giving unsaturated uronic acid, which can be detected by measuring the absorbance at 232 nm.

In this technique the cleavage plane of a nanostructured semiconductor material is imaged with an STM tip at the atomic scale revealing the structural and the electronic properties of the embedded nanostructures. Mn doped III-V semiconductors have been extensively explored in the last decade because of their ferromagnetic properties. Sb is often used as a surfactant to assist in the formation of nanostructured materials or to open special wavelength areas in photonic applications. Both Mn and Sb show a complex behavior and often ill understood behavior during growth. In this study we have used XSTM to explore a number of issues related to the incorporation and behavior Mn and Sb during the growth of nanostructured materials. Thin GaMnAs/(Al,Ga)As superlattices have been predicted to have an enhanced Curie temperature compared to bulk GaMnAs. However X-STM measurements on thin GaMnAs/(Al,Ga)As multilayers structures have shown that even if the nanostructures are grown at low-temperature (250oC), about 20% of Mn atoms segregate into the (Al,Ga)As barriers putting a serious constraint in the realization of an enhanced Curie Temperature. Recently InMnSb has been explored as a new semiconductor material with ferromagnetic properties at room temperature. This material exhibits ferromagnetism at room temperature and has a Curie temperature exceeding 500oC but several material related questions such as phase purity have been raised. The X-STM study of InMnSb revealed that the crystal phase is purely zinc-blend with no evidence of a second phase or cluster formation. The Mn distribution inside the InSb is fully random beyond the X-STM resolution for observing individual impurities, which is about 3 nm. Well-resolved percolation pathways due to the random Mn distribution in InSb were revealed for the first time. The percolative pathways are suggested to be responsible for the observed ferromagnetism at room temperature. In order to create spintronic semiconductor materials that show magnetic behavior at room temperature, MnAs nanoclusters have been embedded in a semiconductor host. X-STM measurements have shown that the MnAs clusters in GaAs have a hexagonal shape and that the Mn content has a strong influence on the size of the nanoclusters. The GaAs matrix exhibits a perfect zincblende crystal phase around the clusters while Mn concentration around the clusters is much smaller than the intended concentration indicating that Mn efficiently migrates during the last annealing step to form the clusters. The influence of Sb on the growth AlAsSb/InGaAs quantum wells has been investigated. The effect of surface termination of the interface layers has been studied. It was proven that the sharpness of the interface is uncorrelated with the conditions of the surface termination. Every AlAsSb barrier shows a steep onset but a gradual Sb profile into the capping layer. Furthermore a comparison has been made between InGaAs barriers grown by the so-called digital alloy method or by a conventional MBE method. The samples grown by the so-called digital alloy method show degraded structural properties but a more intense PL emission than the samples where the InGaAs barriers were grown with a conventional MBE method. X-STM measurements have shown that digital InGaAs alloy exhibit periodic composition modulation in the direction lateral to the growth with a periodicity of about 10 nm. This lateral modulation leads to a better confinement of the carriers and this results in a higher recombination rate due to a better overlap of the electron-hole wavefunctions. Nominally symmetric GaAsSb/InGaAs quantum cascade lasers were also investigated by X-STM. PL emission of these lasers showed different spectra depending on the direction of the current flow. X-STM measurements have shown that the profile of the Sb distribution is steep on the onset of the GaAsSb layers but less sharp at the interface with the capping layer. Also an asymmetric strain distribution is observed in the GaAsSb layers, which is due to segregation of Sb into the InGaAs layers that lowers the Sb concentration in the GaAsSb layers. Both effects break the symmetry of the structure of the layer structure and results in the observed current polarity effects in the PL spectra. The effect of the substrate orientation on the growth of InAs in GaAsSb was explored. Quantum dot formation was observed when InAs was deposited on a 311B GaAsSb surface However, the deposition of InAs on a 100 GaAsSb surface leads only to the formation of a wetting layer. This is due to the curious role of Sb in semiconductor growth.",,,,0,[],Mauger,,False,

One source that always will be available is the energy of the sun. Sunlight energy may be captured in roughly three ways: as heat, electricity, or chemical energy. Heat may be used directly or used to power for example an electricity generator. Sunlight may be used to drive chemical reactions, where energy is stored in chemical bonds. Finally, sunlight can be converted directly into electricity. Since electricity is possibly the most valuable and versatile form of energy, the direct conversion deserves attention. By increasing the efficiency and lowering device cost, a more sustainable global energy society may be achieved. At present, the photovoltaic solar energy market is dominated by solar cells based on high-purity silicon. Producing this high-purity material takes considerable effort and cost, and therefore cheaper, more environmentally friendly alternatives are being explored. Polymer photovoltaics is an option, but the morphological stability of this type of devices is currently one of the issues that hinders commercialization. Hybrid polymer solar cells, using an inorganic material combined with an organic polymer, overcome this issue due to the morphological stability of the inorganic component, while combining this stability with the advantages of solution processing of organic materials. This thesis focuses on characterizing the morphology of hybrid ZnO-polymer solar cells, and altering the morphology to enhance the power conversion efficiency of these devices. Chapter 2 describes the use of an in-situ sol-gel precursor method to make hybrid ZnO-polymer solar cells and strategies to obtain maximum power conversion efficiency. Organic ZnO precursors with different reactivity have been tested in combination with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to create the photoactive layers. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were measured on the devices. The morphology and surface roughness of the active layers was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). From these studies diethylzinc emerged as the best working ZnO precursor in combination with P3HT. The efficiency of polymer solar cells critically depends on the intimacy of mixing of the donor and acceptor semiconductors used in these devices to create charges and on the presence of unhindered percolation pathways in the individual components to transport holes and electrons. Therefore, the e ect of three-dimensional morphology of the active layer on the efficiency was investigated in chapter 3. For ZnO:P3HT cells the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) improves with increasing layer thickness. Photoinduced absorption measurements indicated less triplet state formation in thick layers, meaning that excitons created in these thick layers are better separated into free charges compared to thin films. Three-dimensional transmission electron microscopy (3D-TEM) tomography revealed the 3D morphology in great detail and allowed to determine the probability to find P3HT domains at a certain distance from a ZnO domain with nanometer resolution. From these data the exciton dissociation efficiency of the layers was calculated by solving the 3D exciton diffusion equation in three dimensions, and the percolation pathways for electrons in the ZnO phase were analyzed. Exciton dissociation was higher in thicker blends, explaining the higher IQE for these layers, while the available percolation pathways for electrons in the ZnO were reduced with increasing layer thickness. In chapter 4 it is shown that the morphology of the active layer can be controlled by introducing polar side groups in the polymer. Carboxylic acid esters and alcohols introduce hydrophilicity into the polymer, making it more compatible with the hydrophilic ZnO. 3D TEM analyses have shown that the intimacy of mixing and the extent of exciton dissociation are indeed improved significantly for thin active layers. Device performance was still limited due to the lower amount of ZnO connected to the respective electrode hindering charge collection, and lower hole mobility of the polymer, which is not able to form a crystalline phase as observed in the optical absorption due to the very intimate mixing with ZnO. To absorb more light, in chapter 5 poly(3-hexylselenophene) (P3HS) was tested with ZnO in solar cells. The advantage of P3HS is a smaller optical band gap than P3HT, such that more photons from the solar spectrum can be absorbed, leading to higher current and efficiency. Device optimization was performed and active layers were analyzed using TEM. Eventually, the device performance was less compared to ZnO:P3HT blends. This could be ascribed to a lower exciton dissociation from excitons in the crystalline part of P3HS, judging from the difference in shape of absorption compared to the shape of the EQE. Probably, the lifetime and/or exciton diffusion length in crystalline P3HS is shorter than in amorphous P3HS. Chapter 6 describes the use of a ZnO nanorod template layer, infiltrated with a ZnO:P3HT blend to create a hybrid ZnO-polymer solar cell that features a hierarchically built inorganic phase, with 300 nm ZnO nanorods for charge collection connected to a fine ZnO network for charge generation throughout the bulk. These hierarchical ZnO:P3HT layers were prepared by casting P3HT and diethylzinc (as reactive ZnO precursor) from a common solvent mixture in moist atmosphere on a ZnO nanorod carpet grown from a compact ZnO nucleation layer, followed by thermal conversion. AFM and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the infiltration of the ZnO:P3HT blend in between the ZnO nanorods. Photoinduced absorption spectroscopy revealed that the relative efficiency of charge generation in the ZnO:P3HT blend layers is not influenced by connecting to the ZnO nanorod carpet. We find that the performance of the combined ZnO nanorod ZnO:P3HT blend solar cells is not improved compared to ZnO:P3HT blend cells without nanorods and, actually, somewhat less. This is interpreted as being due to a poor contact between the ZnO network in the ZnO:P3HT blend and the ZnO nanorods. In conclusion, the research described in this thesis provides a first, detailed insight in the relation between the active layer morphology and the performance of hybrid metal oxide - polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells. The morphology can be controlled by changing the deposition conditions (e.g. spin rate), the nature of the polymer (e.g. presence of polar side chains), and using metal oxide template structures (e.g. nanorod carpet). In the best devices power conversion efficiencies of 2% in simulated solar light have been obtained. The thesis demonstrates that the main challenge toward more efficient solar cells is creating a morphology that is fine enough for efficient exciton dissociation and coarse enough to maintain a high mobility of charge carriers and short percolation pathways to the electrodes. A first attempt to achieving such a morphology has been described in the last chapter.",,,,0,[],Oosterhout,,False,

The NanoArray assay system enables detection, identification, and quantitation of clinically relevant, low-abundance proteins from a wide variety of sample types for applications such as biomarker analysis, translational medicine, and toxicology. NanoInk assays consume much smaller sample and reagent volumes than do traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent and bead-based assays and thus generate more proteomic data with less starting material while lowering assay costs for tests. The benefits are explained in a video, “NanoArray assays: More proteomic data from less sample,” available on NanoInk’s website.

The OptiFIB Viper incorporates a new coaxial photon-ion column to provide spot sizes 50% smaller than those of the OptiFIB-IV. It operates at lower beam energies, helps to prevent damage to sensitive materials, and enables endpoint capability at sub-picoampere beam currents. The OptiFIB Viper operates efficiently in the face of the dimensional and material challenges of technologies beyond 22 nm. At low beam currents, small-geometry device features are more easily resolved. The system has practical resolution at 15 kV and below, so sensitive materials are circuit edited without damage; better sample exchange pump-down efficiency; an in-chamber stage and jet movement observation camera for user reference; and improved flexibility to accommodate frequently used apertures.

With its large exciton binding energy of ~60 meV, ZnO is a promising candidate for high stability, room-temperature luminescent and lasing devices [1]. Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on ZnO homojunctions had been reported [2,3], while preparing stable p-type ZnO is still a challenge. An alternative way is to use other p-type semiconductors, ether inorganic or organic, to form heterojunctions with the naturally n-type ZnO. The crystal structure of wurtzite ZnO can be described as Zn and O atomic layers alternately stacked along the [0001] direction. Because of the fastest growth rate over the polar (0001) facet, ZnO crystals tend to grow into one-dimensional structures, such as nanowires and nanobelts. Since the first report of ZnO nanobelts in 2001 [4], ZnO nanostructures have been particularly studied for their potential applications in nano-sized devices. Various growth methods have been developed for growing ZnO nanostructures, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), Metal-organic CVD (MOCVD), aqueous growth and electrodeposition [5]. Based on the successful synthesis of ZnO nanowires/nanorods, various types of hybrid light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were made. Inorganic p-type semiconductors, such as GaN, Si and SiC, have been used as substrates to grown ZnO nanorods/nanowires for making LEDs. GaN is an ideal material that matches ZnO not only in the crystal structure but also in the energy band levels. However, to prepare Mg-doped p-GaN films via epitaxial growth is still costly. In comparison, the organic semiconductors are inexpensive and have many options to select, for a large variety of p-type polymer or small-molecule semiconductors are now commercially available. The organic semiconductor has the limitation of durability and environmental stability. Many polymer semiconductors are susceptible to damage by humidity or mere exposure to oxygen in the air. Also the carrier mobilities of polymer semiconductors are generally lower than the inorganic semiconductors. However, the combination of polymer semiconductors and ZnO nanostructures opens the way for making flexible LEDs. There are few reports on the hybrid LEDs based on ZnO/polymer heterojunctions, some of them showed the characteristic UV electroluminescence (EL) of ZnO. 

This chapter reports recent progress of the hybrid LEDs based on ZnO nanowires and other inorganic/organic semiconductors. We provide an overview of the ZnO-nanowire-based hybrid LEDs from the perspectives of the device configuration, growth methods of ZnO nanowires and the selection of p-type semiconductors.

To increase the efficiency, functionality and to reduce production costs of these devices, the development of new functional electronic materials is essential. Carbon-based materials have the potential to provide many of the needed functionalities. That is, organic chemistry is able to provide a large number of different molecules consisting of primarily carbon which offer tunable electronic properties. This way, molecules can be used to make organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for lighting and displays, organic solar cells for energy harvesting and even micro electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) that tell your smart phone which side is up. Carbon can also be grown in single layers called graphene. Graphene offers the potential of high-speed logic and may be the basis of completely new types of switching devices such as (pseudo)-spintronic devices. The key to creating functional electronic materials from carbon is getting the right structure. Therefore this thesis focusses on the influence of the structure on the electronic properties of p-conjugated systems (i.e. graphene, electronic functionalized molecules, etc.). In the first part of this thesis this influence is studied for a graphene layer grown on silicon carbide (SiC), in which the graphene/SiC interface has a strong influence on the electronic properties, and for the formation of a graphene layer by decomposing C60 on a Pt(111) surface, where the exact process of decomposition results in a particular graphene/Pt(111) interface structure. The second part of this thesis deals with the polymer system poly(3,4-ethylenediox-thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). PEDOT: PSS is a transparent conducting material which can be used in OLEDs and organic solar cells, where it is typically applied by spin coating from emulsion. Here PEDOT and PSS are found to form filaments, resulting in a spaghetti-like morphology of the spin cast layer, which has important consequences for the charge transport. In Chapter 2, graphene grown by thermal decomposition of SiC is studied by atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). At small bias voltages STM images reveal the graphene lattice structure, as expected. However, at increased bias voltages bright features are revealed which, by comparing STS to angular resolved photo emission spectroscopy (ARPES), are shown to be localized states of the interface layer between the graphene and the SiC. Additionally, close to structural defects in the graphene layer a giant inelastic tunneling process, caused by electron-phonon coupling, is observed. This process accounts for half the total tunneling current. A map of this inelastic current shows that these inelastic contributions are strongest at the localized states of the interface layer. Therefore it is expected that the localized states of the interface layer have an important yet complicated influence on the electronic properties of graphene on SiC. In Chapter 3, the full pathway from room temperature deposition of C60 on Pt(111) to the formation of graphene at high temperatures is presented. Using in-situ low temperature STM, a submonolayer of C60 on Pt(111) is studied after heating steps at increasing temperatures. We are able to identify the molecular orientations of the C60 molecules at each step. Changes in the apparent height of C60 molecules in combination with a change in their orientation show that C60 molecules adopt a subsurface missing-atom configuration. By studying the graphene layer formed upon an additional high temperature heating step, both by STM and by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that v3xv3R30° domains of the formed graphene layer are also in a subsurface missing-atom configuration. It is shown that the transition toward the subsurface missing-atom configuration takes place at the edges of C60 islands and could be assisted by the instability of the Pt(111) surface. In Chapter 4, the mechanism and magnitude of the in-plane conductivity of PEDOT:PSS thin films is determined using temperature dependent conductivity measurements for various PEDOT:PSS weight ratios. For all studied weight ratios the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is well described by quasi 1D variable range hopping (VRH). The experimentally determined conductivity varies over three orders of magnitudes and follows a power law with power 3.5 as a function of the weight fraction of PEDOT in PEDOT:PSS in the range 0.04-0.3. Analysis of the field dependent conductivity shows a behavior that is consistent with quasi-1D VRH. Combined, these observations suggest that conductance takes place via a percolating network of quasi-1D filaments. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) filamentary structures are indeed observed both in vitrified solutions and in dried films. For PEDOT:PSS films that were processed with a high boiling solvent, the temperature dependence of the Ohmic conductivity suggests a quasi-1D VRH system, but the low characteristic temperature indicates that the system is close the critical regime between a metal and an insulator. In this case, the conductivity scales linearly with the weight fraction of PEDOT in PEDOT:PSS, indicating the conduction is no longer limited by a percolation of filaments. The lack of observable changes in TEM upon addition of the high boiling solvent suggests that the changes in conductivity are due to a smaller spread in the conductivities of individual filaments, or a higher probability for neighboring filaments to be connected, rather than being due to morphological modification of the filaments. In Chapter 5, the room temperature out-of-plane conductivity of spin coated PEDOT:PSS films is studied. Although important for its application as transparent conductor in light emitting and photovoltaic devices, studies to the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS rarely address the out-of-plane conductivity and those that do report widely varying results. In the presented experiment, the out-of-plane charge transport in thin films of PEDOT:PSS is systematically studied by varying its composition. To this end, small vias between metallic contacts are used. An unexpected, but strong dependence of the conductivity on via diameter is observed. The change in conductivity correlates with a diameter dependent change in PEDOT:PSS layer thickness. The more than three orders of magnitude variation in out-of-plane conductivity with only a 3-4-fold layer thickness variation can quantitatively be explained on basis of a percolating cluster model. This model describes the probability for conductive paths between the top and bottom electrode to be formed from randomly placed conductive elements in an insulating matrix, and shows that for thin layers this probability strongly decreases with increasing layer thickness. The results also rationalize previously unexplained findings in molecular junctions where PEDOT:PSS is used as contact electrode. In Chapter 6, the out-of-plane conductivity of spin coated PEDOT:PSS films is studied for varying temperatures, electric fields and composition. Recent measurements of the out-of-plane conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, and of the conductivity of a semiconducting polymer in a field effect device reveal a curious power law dependence of the conductivity on field and temperature in both the Ohmic and non-Ohmic regimes. This is referred to as universal scaling. Connecting this behavior to a particular microscopic model has proven to be difficult. Here we have performed a systematic study of the temperature and bias voltage dependence of the out-of-plane conductivity of PEDOT:PSS through the use of interconnect structures (vias) for varying via diameters and various PEDOT:PSS formulations. The measurements indeed show universal scaling. By use of explicit knowledge of the microscopic structure of the used PEDOT:PSS materials the number of possible underlying models can be narrowed down to only three models: a model for finite size effects in quasi one-dimensional variable range hopping, a model for a chain of quantum dots in the Coulomb blockade regime and a model for connected Luttinger liquids. The presented measurements seem at odds with all but the latter model. Summarizing, this thesis characterizes the relationship between the electronic properties of p-conjugated systems and their structural properties for two systems, graphene and PEDOT:PSS. For graphene, this is shown for two individual cases, one discusses the influence of localized states of an interface layer below graphene on SiC, the other discusses the formation of a missing atom interface structure of the Pt(111) surface below a graphene layer. The second part of this thesis presents a concerted effort studying the charge transport properties of PEDOT:PSS. Starting from its structure, which is found to consist of a random (percolating) network of filaments, a very complete set of measurements could be accurately described. This includes the in- and out-of-plane conductivity of PEDOT:PSS as a function of temperature, electric field and PEDOT:PSS ratio. The uncovered filamentary structure differs from the current literature which typically describes PEDOT:PSS as consisting of grains with a PEDOT-rich core and PSS-rich shell. Given the lower percolation threshold for filaments than for grains, filamentary PEDOT:PSS is likely to have a higher conductivity than grain-like PEDOT:PSS. It is therefore not unlikely that with the efforts to increase the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, changes have been made in the synthesis of commercial PEDOT:PSS to produce filamentary instead of grain-like PEDOT:PSS. The presented model for the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS offers a good starting point for further rational optimization of the properties of PEDOT:PSS.",,,,0,[],Ruit,,False,

The approach taken in the project was to compare electrical measurements made on mineral surfaces with atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to observations made at the column-scale using traditional spectral induced polarization measurements. In the project we evaluated a number of techniques for investigating the surface properties of materials, including the development of a new AFM measurement protocol that utilizes an external electric field to induce grain-scale polarizations that can be probed using a charged AFM tip. The experiments we performed focused on idealized systems (i.e., glass beads and silica gel) where we could obtain the high degree of control needed to understand how changes in the pore environment, which are determined by biogeochemical controls in the subsurface, affect mechanisms contributing to complex electrical conductivity, i.e., conduction and polarization, responses. The studies we performed can be classified into those affecting the chemical versus physical properties of the grain surface and pore space. Chemical alterations of the surface focused on evaluating how changes in pore fluid pH and ionic composition control surface conduction. These were performed as column flow through experiments where the pore fluid was exchanged in a column of silica gel. Given that silica gel has a high surface area due to internal grain porosity, high-quality data could be obtained where the chemical influences on the surface are clearly apparent and qualitatively consistent with theories of grain (i.e., Stern layer) polarization controlled by electrostatic surface sorption processes (i.e., triple layer theory). Quantitative fitting of the results by existing process-based polarization models (e.g., Leroy et al., 2008) has been less successful, however, due to what we have attributed to differences between existing models developed for spherical grains versus the actual geometry associated with the nano-pores in the silica gel, though other polarization processes, e.g., proton hopping along the surface (Skold et al., 2013), may also be a contributing factor. As an alternative model-independent approach to confirming the link between surface sorption and SIP we initiated a study that will continue (unfunded) beyond the completion of this project to independently measure the accumulation of gamma emitting isotopes on the silica gel during the SIP monitoring experiments. Though our analyses of the project data are ongoing, our preliminary analyses are generally supportive of the grain (Stern layer) polarization theory of SIP. Experiments focused on evaluating the impact of physical modifications of the medium on polarization included etching and biotic and abiotic facilitated precipitation of carbonate and iron oxides to alter the roughness and electrical conductivity of the surfaces. These experiments were performed for both silica gel and glass beads, the latter of which lacked the interior porosity and high surface area of the silica gel. The results appear to be more nuanced that the chemical modifications of the system. In general, however, it was found that deposition of iron oxides and etching had relatively minimal or negative impacts on the polarization response of the medium, whereas carbonate coatings increased the polarization response. These results were generally consistent with changes in surface charge observed via AFM. Abiotic and biotic column flow through experiments demonstrated that precipitation of carbonate within the medium significantly impacted the real and imaginary conductivity over time in a manner generally consistent with the carbonate precipitation as observed from the batch grain coating experiments. Biotic effects were not observed to provide distinctly different signatures, but may have contributed to differences in the rate of changes observed with SIP. AFM was used in a variety of different ways to investigate the grain surfaces throughout the course of the project. Standard imaging methods were used to evaluate surface roughness and charge density, which showed that these data could provide qualitative insights about consistency between surface trends and the electrical behavior at the column scale (for the case of glass beads). Polarization and conductive force microscopy (PCFM) measurements were developed by the original project PI (Treavor Kendall), which illustrated the importance of the initial few monolayers of water on the mineral surface for producing surface conductivity. The technique allowed for initial local estimates of complex electrical conductivity on mineral surfaces, but could not be pursued after Kendall left the project due to phase locking limitations with the AFM instrument at Clemson and an inability to perform measurements in solution, which limited their value for linking the measurements to column-scale SIP responses. As a result, co-PI Dean developed a new methodology for making AFM measurements within an externally applied electric field. In this method, the charged tip of an AFM probe is brought within the proximity of a polarization domain while an external electric field is applied to the sample. The premise of the approach is that the tip will be attracted to or rebound from charge accumulations on the surface, which allow for detection of the local polarization response.

As a result, there is only poor understanding, and hence use, of RTP in industry. This is potentially a cost-increasing limitation, because RTP can decrease cost by decreasing processing time, and as such, increase throughput and decrease the total thermal budget of processing - a significant cost. RTP is already being used for key processing steps in PV technologies. With silicon wafer PV, it is used for establishing electrical contact between the Ag metal grid and the silicon (known as firing). In this process, a silicon wafer with deposited metal/frit in a grid pattern is heated rapidly to temperatures between 750 and 800 ºC. The processing time when the temperature is held above 600ºC is short (<5 seconds). This process has historically been optimized empirically and it is unclear how the thermal processing affects formation of the final contact between the metal and the silicon. In the case of thin-film PV, RTP has been demonstrated in the process of making absorber layers, i.e. CIGS and CZTS. Use of RTP can reduce the processing time from 10s of minutes to seconds, reducing the thermal budget and increasing the throughput significantly. The conversion from precursor material to final PV material is not well understood, and most of the process optimization is done empirically. Again, the proposed in situ monitoring will provide insight into the conversion process. We have developed a unique instrument for in situ monitoring of the reaction process during RTP. The most fundamental property to monitor is the atomic arrangement (for solids, crystalline structure) and thus we have focused on this property. The chamber was designed to collect X-ray diffraction (XRD) for crystal phase determination, although it has lent insight in the formation of liquids. We designed and constructed both inert (air) and reactive (S/Se) versions of this chamber. We have applied the RTP-XRD methodology to: silicon solar cell electrical contact formation; the reaction sequence for forming CIGS PV thin films from copper selenide and indium gallium selenide precursors; the phase sequence for forming HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3) and CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) hybrid-perovskite PV thin films. The RTP instrument enables real-time collection of X-ray diffraction data with intervals as short as 100 ms, and while heating at ramp rates as high 100 ºCs-1 up to 1200 ºC. The system is portable and can be installed on a synchrotron beamline. The RTP reactor consists of a metallic body (front cap assembly, central block and end cap assembly) that houses a quartz reaction chamber. The sample is secured inside the reaction chamber on a sample holder connected to the front-cap assembly. Modifications of the chamber were made for safely handling sulfur and selenium vapor environments. A Se/S source holder was added to generate a Se/S over pressure in the chamber on heating and the entrance window is made wider in order to accommodate the detachable additional holder. Se/S are toxic in nature and therefore a proper Se/S trapping is used before releasing the gases to exhaust. Screen-printing provides an economically attractive means for making Ag electrical contacts to Si solar cells, but the use of Ag substantiates a significant manufacturing cost, and the glass frit used in the paste to enable contact formation contains Pb. To achieve optimal electrical performance and to develop pastes with alternative, abundant, and non-toxic materials requires understanding the contact formation process during firing. We use the RTP-XRD chamber during firing of Ag-Si contacts to reveal the reaction sequence for contact formation. The findings show that between 500 ºC and 650 ºC PbO in the frit etches the SiNx antireflective-coating on the solar cell, exposing the Si surface. Then, above 650 ºC, Ag+ dissolves into the molten glass frit – key for enabling deposition of metallic Ag on the emitter surface and precipitation of Ag nanocrystals within the glass. This clarifies contact formation mechanisms and can be used to suggest approaches for development of inexpensive, nontoxic solar cell contacting pastes. We used the RTP/XRD chamber to study the formation of CuInGaS/Se (CIGS) PV films by in-situ selenization of pre-deposited metal stacks and annealing of pre-deposited Cu-In-Ga-Se precursors. During the metal stack selenization, we observed that Se first reacts with the metals and forms selenides. We observed formation of intermetallics such as Cu2In and binary selenides during heating. On further annealing in a Se atmosphere, CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 forms which on heating up to 550 °C reacts further to form the CIGS phase. On prolonged exposure to 550 °C for more than 5 mins or higher temperature, we see separation into Ga-rich and Ga-depleted CIGS phases. On introducing a holding step at 400 °C for 10 min during the annealing ramp, the CIGS phase (forms between 500-550 °C), appears to be less prone to decomposition into high-Ga and low-Ga phases during holding at peak temperature. Lead halide perovskites have emerged as successful optoelectronic materials with high photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies and low material cost. However, substantial challenges remain in the scalability, stability and fundamental understanding of the materials. We demonstrated the application of radiative thermal annealing, an easily scalable processing method, for synthesizing formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite solar absorbers. Devices fabricated from films formed via radiative thermal annealing have equivalent efficiencies to those annealed using a conventional hotplate. By coupling results from in situ x-ray diffraction using a radiative thermal annealing system with device performances, we mapped the processing phase space of FAPbI3 and corresponding device efficiencies. Our map of processing-structure-performance space suggests the commonly used FAPbI3 annealing time, 10 min at 170 °C, can be significantly reduced to 40 s at 170 °C without affecting the photovoltaic performance. Applying the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model to the decomposition into PbI2, the activation energy was determined. We also presented a well-controlled, manufacturing relevant annealing method, radiative thermal annealing, for the methylammonium lead triiodide films formed by solvent engineering process, with dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent and diethyl ether as the antisolvent. Radiative thermal annealing can produce high quality perovskite films, evidenced by high efficiency solar cell devices, in a shorter time than the widely-used hotplate annealing. Using in-situ x-ray diffraction during the radiative annealing, we show that the role of the antisolvent is not to form an intermediate compound (a methylammonium iodide, lead iodide, and dimethyl sulfoxide compound) by washing of the main solvent (DMF) but to achieve a pin-hole free, uniform film of methylammonium lead iodide. We find that having the intermediate compound does not guarantee a high quality (pin-hole free) perovskite film. Our study was extended to reveal the effect of annealing environment, annealing temperature profile, and deposition substrate.",,,,0,[],,,False,

Recently, scientists at Linac Coherent Light Source, Stanford, USA, have reported the amorphous to crystalline phase transition of carbon by femtosecond 830 eV XFEL beam. The research group employed atomic force microscopy, photoelectron microscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy to discuss the change of the sp2/sp3 ratio (graphitization), as well as the change of local order of the irradiated sample area. It was found that the phase transition threshold fluence is 282 ± 11 mJ/cm2, and also, the transition is mainly due to thermal activation rather than a nonthermal mechanism such as ionization and so on. For more information, see the paper ‘Amorphous to crystalline phase transition in carbon induced by intense femtosecond X-ray free-electron laser pulses’, J. Gaudin et al., Phys. Rev. B86, 024103 (2012). DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.86.024103 Resonant X-ray scattering is a powerful technique for the study of electronic structure at the nanoscale. However, the optical properties of the constituent components of a material must be known prior to modeling of the scattered intensity. Professor J. B. Kortright (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA) and his collaborator have recently proposed a method of refining electronic structure, in the form of optical properties, simultaneously with physical structure, in a Kramers–Kronig (K–K) consistent manner. This technique has been applied to specular reflectivity from a SrTiO3 single crystal, and both a nonresonant surface contaminant layer and a modified SrTiO3 surface region have been evidenced. For more information, see the paper ‘Kramers–Kronig constrained modeling of soft X-ray reflectivity spectra: Obtaining depth resolution of electronic and chemical structure’, K. H Stone et al., Phys. Rev. B86, 024102 (2012). DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.86.024102 Several electron-microscopist groups have recently reported that a Si drift detector with a 60–100 mm2 effective area can be used to detect characteristic X-rays from a single atom in nanomaterials such as silicon and platinum in monolayer and multilayer grapheme, as well as erbium in a C82 fullerene cage supported in a single-walled carbon nanotube. They employed a tiny electron beam of 0.1 nm in the aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. As will be clear for readers of X-ray Spectroscopy journal, the discussion is a kind of major and/or minor component analysis of extremely small volume rather than so-called ultra trace element analysis. The signal intensity was apparently very weak but was in the order of some counts/s according to the reports. Such high sensitivity points to the significant potential of the energy dispersive detector system. On the other hand, further detailed analysis including the estimation of parasitic background will be necessary. For more information, see the papers ‘Single atom identification by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy’, T. C. Lovejoy et al., Appl. Phys. Lett., 100, 154101 (2012) DOI:10.1063/1.3701598, and ‘Detection of photons emitted from single erbium atoms in energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy’, K. Suenaga et al., Nature Photonics, advanced online publication DOI:10.1038/nphoton.2012.148 One very interesting outcome at Linac Coherent Light Source, Stanford, USA has recently been published. The experiment was single-shot imaging of ferromagnetic, nanoscale spin order taken with femtosecond XFEL pulses. For more information, see the paper ‘Femtosecond single-shot imaging of nanoscale ferromagnetic order in Co/Pd multilayers using resonant X-Ray holography’, T. Wang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 267403 (2012). DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.267403 High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a universal response of atoms and molecules in strong femtosecond laser fields and can be used to generate coherent photons in the soft X-ray region. Simply speaking, HHG is the coherent version of an X-ray tube; instead of accelerating thermal electrons emitted from the filament and generating incoherent X-rays by hitting a metallic target, HHG begins with tunnel ionization of an atom in a strong laser field. The portion of the electron wave function that escapes the atom is accelerated by the laser electric field and, when driven back to its parent ion by the laser, can coherently convert its kinetic energy into a high-harmonic photon. So far, for many cases, around 100 near-infrared laser photons have been combined to generate bright, phase-matched, extreme ultraviolet beams when the emission from many atoms is added constructively. Recently, a team led by Professor H. C. Kapteyn and Professor M. M. Murnane (University of Colorado at Boulder, USA) has employed a mid-infrared femtosecond laser in a high-pressure gas and succeeded in getting ultrahigh harmonics up to orders greater than 5000, resulting in a bright continuum spectra ranging from 0.2 to around 1.6 keV. The energy has still not yet reached the hard X-ray regime, but this would be a very attractive coherent ultra short pulse source for soft X-rays. For more information, see the paper ‘Bright coherent ultrahigh harmonics in the keV X-ray regime from mid-infrared femtosecond lasers’, T. Popmintchev et al., Science, 336, 1287 (2012). DOI:10.1126/science.1218497 Dr D. Babonneau (PhyMat, CNRS UMR 6630, Université de Poitiers, France) and his colleagues have recently analyzed morphological characteristics of nanoripple patterns prepared by broad beam-ion sputtering of Al2O3 and Si3N4 amorphous thin films as well as two-dimensional arrays of Ag nanoparticles obtained by glancing angle deposition on Al2O3 nanorippled buffer layers. They employed three-dimensional (3D) reciprocal space mapping in the grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering geometry.

DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.85.235415 A Swiss group has reported on the design and performance of a novel high-temperature and high-pressure continuous-flow reactor, which allows for X-ray absorption spectroscopy or diffraction in supercritical water and other fluids under high pressure (up to 30 MPa) and temperature (up to 500 °C). For more information, see the paper ‘Design of a continuous-flow reactor for in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy of solids in supercritical fluids’, M. Dreher et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 83, 054101 (2012). DOI:10.1063/1.4719921 A research team led by Professor A. Adriaens (Ghent University, Belgium) has developed a number of useful techniques based on synchrotron X-ray diffraction to see the growth of synthetic corrosion layers in real time. The observation was performed for copper, and the final products were identified as mixtures of nantokite (CuCl), cuprite (Cu2O), and paratacamite (Cu2(OH)3Cl). The team employed a highly sophisticated instrument for growing corrosion using a spin coater, and it could be used for many other similar applications. Experiments were performed at both SRS, Daresbury, and ESRF, Grenoble. For more information, see the paper ‘The use of synchrotron X-rays to observe copper corrosion in real time ’, M. Dowsett et al., Anal. Chem. 84, 4866 (2012). DOI:10.1021/ac300457e An Australian team has reported on its study of a historical self-portrait by Sir Arthur Streeton (1867–1943) with fast-scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy using synchrotron radiation. They employed the event-mode Maia X-ray detector, which has the capability to record elemental maps at megapixels per hour with the full XRF spectrum collected per pixel. The 25 megapixel elemental maps were obtained across the 200 × 300 mm2 scan area. The size of the beam used was 10 × 10 µm2. As heavy brushstrokes of lead white overpaint conceal the portrait, the excitation energy was chosen as 12.6 keV to avoid the influence of extremely strong Pb L fluorescence as well as Raman inelastic scattering. For more information, see the paper ‘High-definition X-ray fluorescence elemental mapping of paintings’, D. L. Howard et al., Anal. Chem. 84, 3278 (2012). DOI:10.1021/ac203462h A research group led by Professor B. Kanngießer (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany) has reported on a new approach for chemical speciation in stratified systems using 3D micro-X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. As XRF mode in XAFS measurement generally leads to distorted spectra because of absorption effects, they developed a reliable reconstruction algorithm. For more information, see the paper ‘Reconstruction procedure for 3D micro X-ray absorption fine structure’, L. Lühl et al., Anal. Chem. 84, 1907 (2012).

For further information, visit the web page http://www.ixasportal.net/ixas/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90&Itemid=134 The 2012 workshop on buried interface science with X-rays and neutrons was held at KEK, Tsukuba, Japan, on 26–28 June 2012. This was the latest in a series of 18 workshops held since 2001. There are increasing demands for sophisticated metrology to observe multilayered materials with nanostructures (dots, wires, etc), which are finding applications in electronic, magnetic, optical, and other devices. X-ray and neutron analysis is known for its ability to observe in a nondestructive manner even ‘buried’ function interfaces as well as the surface. In addition to such inherent advantages, recent remarkable advances in micro analysis and quick time-resolved analysis in X-ray reflectometry are extremely important. The latest progress in novel quantum beam technologies, such as XFELs, ERLs, as well as many other table-top laser-like machines could push such techniques towards further sophisticated applications. The present workshop gathered together those with different research backgrounds, i.e. from semiconductor electronics to chemical biomaterials, and even theoretical groups were invited to give insights into unsolved problems on buried interfaces. Bruker has introduced its new micro-computed tomography (CT) accessory for scanning electron microscopes (SEM). Micro-CT for SEM can add 2D and 3D high-resolution X-ray imaging capabilities to third-party SEMs, allowing the nondestructive analysis of internal microstructures of specimens.

SIGIS 2 combines an IR spectrometer with a single detector element and a scanner system. A rotating head with a scanning mirror allows 360° observation and imaging; a video or IR camera displays an image of the scene. In the basic operating mode, the operator draws a frame in the video image of the area to be examined. The mirror sequentially scans the scene, and the incoming IR radiation is analyzed in real time. The results are visualized by the video image, which is overlaid by an image of the potentially hazardous gas cloud. The direct display of the cloud in the image allows simple assessment of the position and the size of the cloud.

It now features increased maximum magnetic field, improved magnetic field at elevated sample temperatures, and improved vacuum performance. The maximum magnetic field capability at base temperature has been improved from ±2.25 T to ±2.5 T. The CRX-VF can now be operated up to ±2 T from 10 K to 400 K and up to ±1 T from 400 K to 500 K. Previously, only ±0.5 T was possible above 400 K, and no magnetic field was possible above 450 K. A new high-vacuum option has been added for users whose applications require lower base pressures. The PS-HV-CPX option improves vacuum to less than 5 × 10−7 Torr with the station at base temperature, an improvement of two orders of magnitude over the standard vacuum configuration. The high-vacuum option is recommended for applications sensitive to contamination.

According to the company, response times are up to 20 times faster than those of traditional thermopile sensors; energy levels are up to 2000 J for single pulses, and more than 20 kW of average power is provided. The new sensor is designed to handle a wide array of laser-beam sizes, from 20 mm to 180 × 180 mm. It operates on the principle of axial heat flow in the direction of incident laser or light beams, unlike the usual radial flow sensor where heat flows from the center outward. In the axial sensor, heat flows through a thermopile deposited as a thin layer on the heat sink’s surface. It flows only a small distance axially into the substrate, which results in response-time improvements and support for higher power levels.
